NA	10.1007/s13577-021-00554-8	The dysregulated long non-coding RNA A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) has been implicated in the oncogenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction in this study, we detected A1BG-AS1 expression in breast cancer and elucidated the regulatory functions and exact mechanisms of A1BG-AS1 in breast cancer cells. The regulatory functions of A1BG-AS1 were examined in vitro using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometric, and Transwell migration and invasion assays and in vivo through tumor xenograft experiments. In addition, we performed bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments to verify the interaction among A1BG-AS1, microRNA-485-5p (miR-485-5p), and flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in breast cancer. We found A1BG-AS1 to be highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. In terms of function, depleted A1BG-AS1 markedly suppressed cell proliferation, accelerated cell apoptosis, and hindered cell migration and invasion in breast cancer. Furthermore, A1BG-AS1 interference reduced tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations confirmed that A1BG-AS1 directly interacted with miR-485-5p as a molecular sponge. We demonstrated that FLOT1 is a direct target of miR-485-5p, which could be positively regulated by A1BG-AS1 by competing for miR-485-5p. Rescue experiments clearly showed that the downregulation of miR-485-5p and upregulation of FLOT1 were capable of reversing the anticancer activities of A1BG-AS1 deficiency in terms of breast cancer cell malignancy. A1BG-AS1 acts as a miR-485-5p sponge and subsequently increases FLOT1 expression in breast cancer cells, ultimately facilitating cancer progression. Hence, the A1BG-AS1/miR-485-5p/FLOT1 pathway might offer a novel therapeutic perspective for breast cancer.	2021	Long non-coding RNA A1BG-AS1 promotes tumorigenesis in breast cancer by sponging microRNA-485-5p and consequently increasing expression of FLOT1 expression.	34115333	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
NA	10.1002/jcb.28315	Extensive evidence indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulates the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the expression and biological function of lncRNA A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) were poorly known in HCC. Here, we found the underexpression of A1BG-AS1 in HCC via analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Further analyses confirmed that A1BG-AS1 expression in HCC was markedly lower than that in noncancerous tissues based on our HCC cohort. Clinical association analysis revealed that low A1BG-AS1 expression correlated with poor prognostic features, such as microvascular invasion, high tumor grade, and advanced tumor stage. Follow-up data indicated that low A1BG-AS1 level evidently correlated with poor clinical outcomes of HCC patients. Moreover, forced expression of A1BG-AS1 repressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Conversely, A1BG-AS1 knockdown promoted these malignant behaviors in HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, A1BG-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA by directly sponging miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Notably, miR-216a-5p restoration rescued A1BG-AS1 attenuated proliferation, migration and invasion of HCCLM3 cells. A1BG-AS1 positively regulated the levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog and SMAD family member 7, which were reduced by miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Altogether, we conclude that A1BG-AS1 exerts a tumor suppressive role in HCC progression.	2019	lncRNA A1BG-AS1 suppresses proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting miR-216a-5p.	30556161	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

Cord blood DNA methylation was measured by Illumina HumanMethylation 450K in one subset (N = 189) and EPICarray in another (N = 349). High (vegetation height>3 m (m)), low (vegetation height<3 m) and total (including both) high-resolution green space exposures during pregnancy were estimated within 100 m and 1000 m distance around maternal residence. In each subset, we sought cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites via linear mixed models adjusted on newborns' sex, ethnicity, gestational age, season at delivery, sampling day, maternal parity, age, smoking, education, and estimated blood cell proportions. EWASs results were meta-analysed via fixed-effects meta-analyses. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified via ENmix-combp and DMRcate algorithms. Sensitivity analyses were additionally adjusted on PM<sub>2.5</sub>, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income. In the 450K subset, cord blood expression of differentially methylated genes was measured by Agilent microarrays and associated with green space.<h4>Results</h4>147 DMRs were identified, 85 of which were still significant upon adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income, including HLA-DRB5, RPTOR, KCNQ1DN, A1BG-AS1, HTR2A, ZNF274, COL11A1 and PRSS36 DMRs. One CpG reached genome-wide significance, while 54 CpGs were suggestive significant (p-values<1e-05). Among them, a CpG, hypermethylated with 100 m buffer total green space, was annotated to PAQR9, whose expression decreased with 1000 m buffer low green space (p-value = 1.45e-05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results demonstrate that maternal exposure to green space during pregnancy is associated with cord blood DNA methylation, mainly at loci organized in regions, in genes playing important roles in neurological development (e.g., HTR2A).	2023	Epigenome-wide analysis of maternal exposure to green space during gestation and cord blood DNA methylation in the ENVIRONAGE cohort.	36400229	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC9640627	10.1038/s41598-022-23681-0	Aberrant long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression and fatty acid signaling dysfunction both contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence and development. However, the relationship and interaction mechanism between lncRNAs and fatty acid signaling in HCC remain unclear. Data regarding RNA expression and clinical outcomes for patients with HCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), HCCDB, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Hallmark pathways were identified using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method. ConsensusClusterPlus was used to establish a consistency matrix for classifying samples into three subtypes. A risk signature was established, and predictive values for key lncRNAs related to prognosis were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. The ESTIMATE algorithm, MCP-Counter, and ssGSEA were used to evaluate the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment. The CTRP2.0 and PRISM were used to analyze drug sensitivity in HCC subtypes. We discovered seven fatty-acid-associated lncRNAs with predictive prognostic capabilities, including TRAF3IP2-AS1, SNHG10, AL157392.2, LINC02641, AL357079.1, AC046134.2, and A1BG-AS. Three subtypes were obtained, which presented with differences in prognosis, clinical information, mutation features, pathway traits, immune characteristics, and drug sensitivity. The seven key lncRNAs identified in this study might serve as promising biomarkers for predicting prognosis in patients with HCC, and the three HCC subtypes classified according to lncRNA expression profiles could improve HCC classification.	2022	A novel classification of HCC basing on fatty-acid-associated lncRNA.	36344648	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC9706709	10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11790	<h4>Background</h4>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been the subject of considerable attention in recent years due to their role in gene regulation. However, the function of lncRNAs remains poorly understood, especially in the context of infection with low-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs). To further understanding on this issue, we investigated lncRNA expression in HPV-induced common warts.<h4>Methods</h4>A publicly available high-throughput sequencing dataset for common warts was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). lncRNA profiles were generated using the NetworkAnalyst 3.0 workflow, and a list of differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs in common warts was identified and inputted into the ENCODE, RegNetwork, DisGeNet, and miRNet platforms.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 54 lncRNAs were revealed to be significantly dysregulated in common warts. Of these 54 lncRNAs, 24 and 30 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The most significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs in common warts included the <i>CERNA2</i>, <i>LINC02159</i>, <i>SH3PXD2A-AS1</i>, and <i>UNC5B-AS1</i> genes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current findings suggest that HPV-induced warts impact the host lncRNA transcriptome. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the impact of low-risk HPV infection on lncRNA expression profiles.	2022	Network analysis of long non-coding RNA expression profiles in common warts.	36458289	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8806870	10.1080/21655979.2021.1953216	Metabolism affects the development, progression, and prognosis of various cancers, including breast cancer (BC). Our aim was to develop a metabolism-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signature to assess the prognosis of BC patients in order to optimize treatment. Metabolism-related genes between breast tumors and normal tissues were screened out, and Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate metabolism-related lncRNAs. In total, five metabolism-related lncRNAs were enrolled to establish prognostic signatures. Kaplan-Meier plots and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated good performance in both training and validation groups. Further analysis demonstrated that the signature was an independent prognostic factor for BC. A nomogram incorporating risk score and tumor stage was then constructed to evaluate the 3 - and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with BC. In conclusion, this study identified a metabolism-related lncRNA signature that can predict RFS of BC patients and established a prognostic nomogram that helps guide the individualized treatment of patients at different risks.	2021	Metabolism-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential biomarkers for predicting risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients.	34254565	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC9876672	10.1155/2023/8994901	Uveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intraocular malignant tumour that is closely related to autophagic dysfunction. We aimed to identify autophagy-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to elucidate the molecular mechanism of UM. Here, we show that LINC01278 is a new potential biomarker with clinical prognostic value in UM through bioinformatics analysis. Application of an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) and an autophagy agonist (MG-132) indicated that LINC01278 can inhibit UM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inducing autophagy. A xenograft nude mouse model was used to examine the tumorigenesis of UM cells in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC01278 can inhibit the mTOR signalling pathway to activate autophagy, as shown by experiments with an mTOR agonist (MHY1485) and mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) treatment. Our findings indicate that LINC01278 functions as a tumour suppressor by inhibiting the mTOR signalling pathway to induce autophagy. Targeting the LINC01278-mTOR axis might be a novel and promising therapeutic approach for UM.	2023	LINC01278 Induces Autophagy to Inhibit Tumour Progression by Suppressing the mTOR Signalling Pathway.	36713034	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8517989	10.7150/jca.63351	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical drivers and suppressors of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The downregulation of transmembrane protein 220 antisense RNA 1 (TMEM220-AS1) is correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. Nevertheless, the role of TMEM220-AS1 in HCC and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, TMEM220-AS1 levels were markedly reduced in HCC tissues compared with noncancerous tissues. TMEM220-AS1 downregulation was confirmed in HCC cell lines. TMEM220-AS1 expression was associated with tumor stage, venous infiltration, tumor size, and survival of HCC patients. TMEM220-AS1 overexpression suppressed the migration, invasion, and proliferation of HCC cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of TMEM220-AS1 increased TMEM220 levels in HCC cells. Decreased TMEM220 levels were observed in HCC tissues and cell lines. TMEM220 expression was positively correlated with TMEM220-AS1 levels in HCC tissue samples and TMEM220 downregulation was significantly correlated with reduced patient survival. TMEM220 overexpression suppressed HCC cell proliferation and mobility. TMEM220 knockdown eliminated the suppressive effect of TMEM220-AS1 in HCCLM3 cells. Mechanistically, TMEM220 overexpression reduced the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and decreased MYC, Cyclin D1, and Snail1 mRNA levels in HCCLM3 cells. BIO, a GSK3β inhibitor, eliminated TMEM220-induced Wnt/β-catenin pathway inactivation and inhibited HCC cell proliferation and mobility. In conclusion, TMEM220-AS1 and TMEM220 were expressed at low levels in HCC patients. TMEM220-AS1 inhibited the malignant behavior of HCC cells by enhancing TMEM220 expression and subsequently inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.	2021	LncRNA TMEM220-AS1 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the TMEM220/β-catenin axis.	34659569	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC9279027	10.1155/2022/9332844	"<h4>Objective</h4>The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection led to hepatitis, which was one of common reasons for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The immune microenvironment alteration played a crucial role in this process. The study aimed to identify immune-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in HBV-related HCC and explore potential mechanisms.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 1,072 immune-related genes (IRGs) were enriched in different co-expression modules with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) combining the corresponding clinical features in HBV-related HCC. The immune-related lncRNAs were selected from the crucial co-expression model based on the correlation analysis with IRGs. The immune-related lncRNAs were furtherly used to construct prognostic signature by the Cox proportional hazards regression and Lasso regression. Furthermore, the proliferation and migration ability of lncRNA SNHG10 were verified in vitro.<h4>Results</h4>A total of nine co-expression modules were identified by WGCNA of which the ""red"" co-expression module was most correlated with various clinical characteristics. Additionally, the IRGs in this module were significantly enriched in multiple immune-related pathways. The twelve immune-related lncRNAs prognostic signature (HAND2-AS1, LINC00844, SNHG10, MALAT1, LINC00460, LBX2-AS1, MIR31HG, SEMA6A-AS1, LINC1278, LINC00514, CTBP-AS2, and LINC00205) was constructed. The risk score was an independent risk factor in HBV-related HCC and verified by principal components analysis (PCA), nomogram, and PCR between different cell lines. Moreover, the proportion of immune cells were significantly different between high-risk score group and low-risk score group. The malignant behavior of Hep3B was significantly different between si-lncRNA SNHG10 and control group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The immune-related lncRNAs prognostic signature provided some potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in HBV-related HCC."	2022	Immune-Related lncRNAs with WGCNA Identified the Function of SNHG10 in HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	35847362	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

They have a critical role in regulation of cell proliferation and migration. MiRNAs aberrations have been reported in various cancers. Considering the importance of these factors in regulation of cellular processes and their high stability in body fluids, these factors can be suggested as suitable non-invasive markers for the cancer diagnosis. MiR-216a deregulation has been frequently reported in different cancers. Therefore, in the present review we discussed the molecular mechanisms of the miR-216a during tumor progression. It has been reported that miR-216a mainly functioned as a tumor suppressor through the regulation of signaling pathways and transcription factors.

TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway is a highly complicated web of proteins which work spatio-temporally to regulate multiple steps of carcinogenesis. TGFβ/SMAD has been shown to dualistically regulate cancer progression. Therefore, TGFβ/SMAD signaling behaves as a ""double-edged sword"" in molecular oncology. Accordingly, regulation of TGFβ/SMAD is multi-layered because of oncogenic and tumor suppressor long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs). In this review, we have summarized most recent breakthroughs in our understanding related to regulation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling by lncRNAs. We have comprehensively analyzed how different lncRNAs positively and negatively regulate TGFβ/SMAD signaling in different cancers. We have gathered missing pieces of an incomplete jig-saw puzzle of lncRNA-interactome ranging from ""sponge effects"" of lncRNAs to mechanistic modulation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling by lncRNAs."	2021	Regulation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling by long non-coding RNAs in different cancers: Dark Knight in the Castle of molecular oncology.	33511320	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8195627	10.3389/fonc.2021.665388	<h4>Background</h4>Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is encoded by the solute carrier family 2A1 (SLC2A1) gene and is one of the glucose transporters with the greatest affinity for glucose. Abnormal expression of GLUT1 is associated with a variety of cancers. However, the biological role of GLUT1 in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) remains to be determined.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed the expression of GLUT1 in pan-cancer and ESCA as well as clinicopathological analysis through multiple databases. Use R and STRING to perform GO/KEGG function enrichment and PPI analysis for GLUT1 co-expression. TIMER and CIBERSORT were used to analyze the relationship between GLUT1 expression and immune infiltration in ESCA. The TCGA ESCA cohort was used to analyze the relationship between GLUT1 expression and m6A modification in ESCA, and to construct a regulatory network in line with the ceRNA hypothesis.<h4>Results</h4>GLUT1 is highly expressed in a variety of tumors including ESCA, and is closely related to histological types and histological grade. GO/KEGG functional enrichment analysis revealed that GLUT1 is closely related to structural constituent of cytoskeleton, intermediate filament binding, cell-cell adheres junction, epidermis development, and P53 signaling pathway. PPI shows that GLUT1 is closely related to TP53, GIPC1 and INS, and these three proteins all play an important role in tumor proliferation. CIBERSORT analysis showed that GLUT1 expression is related to the infiltration of multiple immune cells. When GLUT1 is highly expressed, the number of memory B cells decreases. ESCA cohort analysis found that GLUT1 expression was related to 7 m6A modifier genes. Six possible crRNA networks in ESCA were constructed by correlation analysis, and all these ceRNA networks contained GLUT1.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GLUT1 can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of ESCA, and is related to tumor immune infiltration, m6A modification and ceRNA network.	2021	Comprehensive Analysis of GLUT1 Immune Infiltrates and ceRNA Network in Human Esophageal Carcinoma.	34123828	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8669964	10.3389/fcell.2021.781285	There are many types of cancers. Although they share some hallmarks, such as proliferation and metastasis, they are still very different from many perspectives. They grow on different organ or tissues. Does each cancer have a unique gene expression pattern that makes it different from other cancer types? After the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, there are more and more pan-cancer studies. Researchers want to get robust gene expression signature from pan-cancer patients. But there is large variance in cancer patients due to heterogeneity. To get robust results, the sample size will be too large to recruit. In this study, we tried another approach to get robust pan-cancer biomarkers by using the cell line data to reduce the variance. We applied several advanced computational methods to analyze the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) gene expression profiles which included 988 cell lines from 20 cancer types. Two feature selection methods, including Boruta, and max-relevance and min-redundancy methods, were applied to the cell line gene expression data one by one, generating a feature list. Such list was fed into incremental feature selection method, incorporating one classification algorithm, to extract biomarkers, construct optimal classifiers and decision rules. The optimal classifiers provided good performance, which can be useful tools to identify cell lines from different cancer types, whereas the biomarkers (e.g. NCKAP1, TNFRSF12A, LAMB2, FKBP9, PFN2, TOM1L1) and rules identified in this work may provide a meaningful and precise reference for differentiating multiple types of cancer and contribute to the personalized treatment of tumors.	2021	Identification of Pan-Cancer Biomarkers Based on the Gene Expression Profiles of Cancer Cell Lines.	34917619	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC7648293	10.1186/s12967-020-02578-4	<h4>Background</h4>Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that immune-related lncRNAs (IRLs) are commonly aberrantly expressed in breast cancer (BC). Thus, we aimed to establish an IRL-based tool to improve prognosis prediction in BC patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We obtained IRL expression profiles in large BC cohorts (N = 911) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, in light of the correlation between each IRL and recurrence-free survival (RFS), we screened prognostic IRL signatures to construct a novel RFS nomogram via a Cox regression model. Subsequently, the performance of the IRL-based model was evaluated through discrimination, calibration ability, risk stratification ability and decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 52 IRLs were obtained from TCGA. Based on multivariate Cox regression analyses, four IRLs (A1BG-AS1, AC004477.3, AC004585.1 and AC004854.2) and two risk parameters (tumor subtype and TNM stage) were utilized as independent indicators to develop a novel prognostic model. In terms of predictive accuracy, the IRL-based model was distinctly superior to the TNM staging system (AUC: 0.728 VS 0.673, P = 0.010). DCA indicated that our nomogram had favorable clinical practicability. In addition, risk stratification analysis showed that the IRL-based tool efficiently divided BC patients into high- and low-risk groups (P < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel IRL-based model was constructed to predict the risk of 5-year RFS in BC. Our model can improve the predictive power of the TNM staging system and identify high-risk patients with tumor recurrence to implement more appropriate treatment strategies.	2020	Molecular characterization of breast cancer: a potential novel immune-related lncRNAs signature.	33160384	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8178833	10.1186/s12864-020-07289-0	<h4>Background</h4>The development of RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and the corresponding emergence of public datasets have created new avenues of transcriptional marker search. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute an emerging class of transcripts with a potential for high tissue specificity and function. Therefore, we tested the biomarker potential of lncRNAs on Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), a complex type of adult multipotent stem cells of diverse tissue origins, that is frequently used in clinics but which is lacking extensive characterization.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a dedicated bioinformatics pipeline for the purpose of building a cell-specific catalogue of unannotated lncRNAs. The pipeline performs ab initio transcript identification, pseudoalignment and uses new methodologies such as a specific k-mer approach for naive quantification of expression in numerous RNAseq data. We next applied it on MSCs, and our pipeline was able to highlight novel lncRNAs with high cell specificity. Furthermore, with original and efficient approaches for functional prediction, we demonstrated that each candidate represents one specific state of MSCs biology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We showed that our approach can be employed to harness lncRNAs as cell markers. More specifically, our results suggest different candidates as potential actors in MSCs biology and propose promising directions for future experimental investigations.	2021	Long non-coding RNA exploration for mesenchymal stem cell characterisation.	34088266	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

The expression level of SLC2A1 in CRC was certified by cell experiments and immunohistochemical staining analysis. The Genome Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analyses of SLC2A1 relative genes were completed by bioinformatics analysis. The correlation between SLC2A1 expression level and CRC immune infiltration cell was analyzed by Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and TCGA database. The correlation between SLC2A1 expression level and ferroptosis and m6A modification of CRC was analyzed by utilizing TCGA and GEO cohort. Finally, the possible competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks involved in SLC2A1 in CRC are predicted and constructed through various databases. <b>Results:</b> SLC2A1 is highly expressed not only in CRC but also in many other tumors. ROC curve indicated that SLC2A1 had high predictive accuracy for the outcomes of tumor. The SLC2A1 expression in CRC was closely correlated with tumor stage and progression free interval (PFI). GO, KEGG, and GSEA analysis indicated that SLC2A1 relative genes were involved in multiple biological functions. The analysis of TIMER, GEPIA, and TCGA database indicated that the SLC2A1 mRNA expression was mainly positively associated with neutrophils. By the analysis of the TCGA and GEO cohort, we identified that the expression of SLC2A1 is closely associated to an m6A modification relative gene Insulin Like Growth Factor 2 MRNA Binding Protein 3 (IGF2BP3) and a ferroptosis relative gene Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4). <b>Conclusion:</b> SLC2A1 can be used as a biomarker of CRC, which is associated to immune infiltration, m6A modification, ferroptosis, and ceRNA regulatory network of CRC.	2022	SLC2A1 is a Diagnostic Biomarker Involved in Immune Infiltration of Colorectal Cancer and Associated With m6A Modification and ceRNA.	35399515	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC7071826	10.7717/peerj.8758	<h4>Background</h4>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis and a high incidence. The molecular changes and novel biomarkers of HCC need to be identified to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. We investigated the current research concentrations of HCC and identified the transcriptomics-related biomarkers of HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) database.<h4>Methods</h4>We investigated the current research concentrations of HCC using literature metrology analysis for studies conducted from 2008 to 2018. We identified long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that correlated with the clinical features and survival prognoses of HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) database. Differentially expressed genes (lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs) were also identified by TCGA datasets in HCC tumor tissues. A lncRNA competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed from lncRNAs based on intersected lncRNAs. Survival times and the association between the expression levels of the key lncRNAs of the ceRNA network and the clinicopathological characteristics of HCC patients were analyzed using TCGA. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the reliability of the results in tissue samples from 20 newly-diagnosed HCC patients.<h4>Results</h4>Analysis of the literature pertaining to HCC research revealed that current research is focused on lncRNA functions in tumorigenesis and tumor development. A total of 128 HCC dysregulated lncRNAs were identified; 66 were included in the co-expressed ceRNA network. We analyzed survival times and the associations between the expression of 66 key lncRNAs and the clinicopathological features of the HCC patients identified from TCGA. Twenty-six lncRNAs were associated with clinical features of HCC (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and six key lncRNAs were associated with survival time (log-rank test <i>P</i> < 0.05). Six key lncRNAs were selected for the validation of their expression levels in 20 patients with newly diagnosed HCC using qRT-PCR. Consistent fold changes in the trends of up and down regulation between qRT-PCR validation and TCGA proved the reliability of our bioinformatics analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We used integrative bioinformatics analysis of the TCGA datasets to improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved with the functional features of lncRNAs in HCC. The results revealed that lncRNAs are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of HCC.	2020	Integrative analysis of dysregulated lncRNA-associated ceRNA network reveals potential lncRNA biomarkers for human hepatocellular carcinoma.	32201648	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC9027862	10.1186/s12967-022-03387-7	Pemphigus is an autoimmune skin disease. Ectopic lymphoid-like structures (ELSs) were found to be commonly present in the pemphigus lesions, presumably supporting in situ desmoglein (Dsg)-specific antibody production. Yet functional phenotypes and the regulators of Lymphoid aggregates in pemphigus lesions remain largely unknown. Herein, we used microarray technology to profile the gene expression in skin lesion infiltrating mononuclear cells (SIMC) from pemphigus patients. On top of that, we compared SIMC dataset to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) dataset to characterize the unique role of SIMC. Functional enrichment results showed that mononuclear cells in skin lesions and peripheral blood both had over-represented IL-17 signaling pathways while neither was characterized by an activation of type I Interferon signaling pathways. Cell-type identification with relative subsets of known RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) results showed that naïve natural killer cells (NK cells) were significantly more abundant in pemphigus lesions, and their relative abundance positively correlated with B cells abundance. Meanwhile, plasma cells population highly correlated with type 1 macrophages (M1) abundance. In addition, we also identified a lncRNA LINC01588 which might epigenetically regulate T helper 17 cells (Th17)/regulatory T cells (Treg) balance via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. Here, we provide the first transcriptomic characterization of lesion infiltrating immune cells which illustrates a distinct interplay network between adaptive and innate immune cells. It helps discover new regulators of local immune response, which potentially will provide a novel path forward to further uncover pemphigus pathological mechanisms and develop targeted therapy.	2022	Transcriptomic profiling of pemphigus lesion infiltrating mononuclear cells reveals a distinct local immune microenvironment and novel lncRNA regulators.	35449056	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8176253	10.7150/jca.58097	Recent reports show that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) FIRRE contributes to the proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and invasion of colorectal cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, the biological function of FIRRE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Here, we disclosed that the FIRRE level was frequently increased in HCC compared to nontumor tissues. Compared with normal liver cells, we also confirmed the upregulated level of FIRRE in HCC cells. Notably, the FIRRE high expression was related to malignant clinical features, including advanced TNM stage and tumor size ≥5 cm, and conferred to worse survival of HCC. Functionally, FIRRE knockdown repressed the proliferation and glycolysis of HCCLM3 cells. Overexpression of FIRRE strengthened Huh7 cell proliferation and glycolysis. Notably, FIRRE positively regulated the glycolic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4) expression in HCC cells. PFKFB4 was highly expressed and positively associated with FIRRE level in HCC tissues. The upregulated expression of PFKFB4 was associated with high tumor grade and advanced TNM stage. TCGA data revealed that the PFKFB4 high expression indicated a poor prognosis of HCC. Mechanistically, modulating FIRRE level did not affect the stability of PFKFB4 mRNA. FIRRE was mainly distributed in HCC cells' nucleus and promoted PFKFB4 transcription and expression via cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). PFKFB4 could abolish the effects of FIRRE knockdown on HCC cell proliferation and glycolysis. To conclude, the highly expressed FIRRE facilitated HCC cell proliferation and glycolysis by enhancing CREB-mediated PFKFB4 transcription and expression.	2021	Long noncoding RNA FIRRE contributes to the proliferation and glycolysis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by enhancing PFKFB4 expression.	34093813	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8582193	10.1186/s41065-021-00208-7	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide due to its high degree of malignancy, high incidence, and low survival rate. However, the underlying mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis remain unclear. Long non coding RNA (lncRNA) has been shown as a novel type of RNA. lncRNA by acting as ceRNA can participate in various biological processes of HCC cells, such as tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and drug resistance by regulating downstream target gene expression and cancer-related signaling pathways. Meanwhile, lncRNA can predict the efficacy of treatment strategies for HCC and serve as a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Therefore, lncRNA serving as ceRNA may become a vital candidate biomarker for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In this review, the epidemiology of HCC, including morbidity, mortality, regional distribution, risk factors, and current treatment advances, was briefly discussed, and some biological functions of lncRNA in HCC were summarized with emphasis on the molecular mechanism and clinical application of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA regulatory network in HCC. This paper can contribute to the better understanding of the mechanism of the influence of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA networks (ceRNETs) on HCC and provide directions and strategies for future studies.	2021	The role of ceRNA-mediated diagnosis and therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.	34758879	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC9273781	10.3389/fgene.2022.900380	<b>Background:</b> This study aimed to screen potential drugs targeting a new prognostic gene signature associated with proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). <b>Methods:</b> CRISPR Library and TCGA datasets were used to explore differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the proliferation of HCC cells. Differential gene expression analysis, univariate COX regression analysis, random forest algorithm and multiple combinatorial screening were used to construct a prognostic gene signature. Then the predictive power of the gene signature was validated in the TCGA and ICGC datasets. Furthermore, potential drugs targeting this gene signature were screened. <b>Results:</b> A total of 640 DEGs related to HCC proliferation were identified. Using univariate Cox analysis and random forest algorithm, 10 hub genes were screened. Subsequently, using multiplex combinatorial screening, five hub genes (FARSB, NOP58, CCT4, DHX37 and YARS) were identified. Taking the median risk score as a cutoff value, HCC patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis performed in the training set showed that the overall survival of the high-risk group was worse than that of the low-risk group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The ROC curve showed a good predictive efficiency of the risk score (AUC > 0.699). The risk score was related to gene mutation, cancer cell stemness and immune function changes. Prediction of immunotherapy suggetsted the IC50s of immune checkpoint inhibitors including A-443654, ABT-888, AG-014699, ATRA, AUY-922, and AZ-628 in the high-risk group were lower than those in the low-risk group, while the IC50s of AMG-706, A-770041, AICAR, AKT inhibitor VIII, Axitinib, and AZD-0530 in the high-risk group were higher than those in the low-risk group. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that FARSB was positively correlated with Hydroxyurea, Vorinostat, Nelarabine, and Lomustine, while negatively correlated with JNJ-42756493. DHX37 was positively correlated with Raltitrexed, Cytarabine, Cisplatin, Tiotepa, and Triethylene Melamine. YARS was positively correlated with Axitinib, Fluphenazine and Megestrol acetate. NOP58 was positively correlated with Vorinostat and 6-thioguanine. CCT4 was positively correlated with Nerabine. <b>Conclusion:</b> The five-gene signature associated with proliferation can be used for survival prediction and risk stratification for HCC patients. Potential drugs targeting this gene signature deserve further attention in the treatment of HCC.	2022	Machine Learning Screens Potential Drugs Targeting a Prognostic Gene Signature Associated With Proliferation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	35836576	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC7962432	10.1186/s40246-021-00316-5	<h4>Background</h4>In the novel coronavirus pandemic, the high infection rate and high mortality have seriously affected people's health and social order. To better explore the infection mechanism and treatment, the three-dimensional structure of human bronchus has been employed in a better in-depth study on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded a separate microarray from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO) on a human bronchial organoids sample to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGS) and analyzed it with R software. After processing with R software, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto PBMCs of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were analyzed, while a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to show the interactions and influence relationships between these differential genes. Finally, the selected highly connected genes, which are called hub genes, were verified in CytoHubba plug-in.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, a total of 966 differentially expressed genes, including 490 upregulated genes and 476 downregulated genes were used. Analysis of GO and KEGG revealed that these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to immune response and cytokines. We construct protein-protein interaction network and identify 10 hub genes, including IL6, MMP9, IL1B, CXCL8, ICAM1, FGF2, EGF, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and FN1. Finally, with the help of GSE150728, we verified that CXCl1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL5, EGF differently expressed before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, we used mRNA expression data from GSE150819 to preliminarily confirm the feasibility of hBO as an in vitro model to further study the pathogenesis and potential treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, based on the mRNA differentiated expression of this model, we found that CXCL8, CXCL10, and EGF are hub genes in the process of SARS-COV-2 infection, and we emphasized their key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection. And we also suggested that further study of these hub genes may be beneficial to treatment, prognostic prediction of COVID-19.	2021	Exploration and validation of related hub gene expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection of human bronchial organoids.	33726831	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

After encountering patients who test positive again after discharge, our study analyzed the pathogenesis to further assess the risk and possibility of virus reactivation. <h4>Methods: </h4>: A separate microarray was acquired from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO), and its samples were divided into two groups: a “convalescent-RTP” group consisting of recovery and “retesting-positive” (RTP) patients (group CR) and a “health-RTP” group consisting of healthy control and RTP patients (group HR). The enrichment analysis was performed with R software, obtaining the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto pluripotent stem cells (KEGG) of the genes and genomes. Subsequently, the protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of each group were established and the hub genes were discovered using the cytoHubba plug-in. <h4>Results: </h4>: In this study, 20 differentially expressed genes were identified, and 6622 genes were identified in the group CR, consisting of 5003 up-regulated and 1619 down-regulated genes. Meanwhile, 7335 genes were screened in the group HR, including 4323 up-regulated and 3012 down-regulated ones. The GO and KEGG analysis of the two groups revealed significant enrichment of these differentially expressed genes in pathways associated with immune response and apoptosis. In the PPI network constructed, 10 hub genes in group CR were identified, including TP53BP1, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SF3B1, SNRNP200, MRPS16, MRPS9, CALM1, PPP2R1A, YWHAZ. Similarly, TP53BP1, RPS15, EFTUD2, MRPL16, MRPL17, MRPS14, RPL35A, MRPL32, MRPS6, POLR2G were selected as hub genes. <h4>Conclusions: </h4>: Using the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression data from GSE166253, we explore the pathogenesis of retesting positive in COVID-19 from the immune mechanism and molecular level. We found TP53BP1, SNRPD1 and SNRPD2 as hub genes in RTP patients. Hence, their regulatory pathway is vital to the management and prognostic prediction of RTP patients, rendering the further study of these hub genes necessary.	2021	Screening the Hub Genes and Analyzing the Mechanisms in Discharged COVID-19 Patients Retesting Positive through Bioinformatics Analysis	NA	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC7709261	10.1186/s40364-020-00252-x	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of liver cancer with poor prognosis. There have been demonstrated to exist many possible mechanisms in HCC tumorigenesis, and recent investigations have provided some promising therapy targets. However, further mechanisms remain to be researched to improve the therapeutic strategy and diagnosis of HCC. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine which plays critical roles in networks of different cellular processes, and TGF-β signaling has been found to participate in tumor initiation and development of HCC in recent years. Moreover, among the molecules and signaling pathways, researchers paid more attention to lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs), but the connection between lncRNAs and TGF-βremain poorly understood. In this review, we conclude the malignant procedure which lncRNAs and TGF-β involved in, and summarize the mechanisms of lncRNAs and TGF-βin HCC initiation and development. Furthermore, the interaction between lncRNA and TGF-β are paid more attention, and the potential therapy targets are mentioned.	2020	Modulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway by long noncoding RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma.	33292618	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8173225	10.3389/fonc.2021.651693	Cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the main first-line treatment strategies for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Unfortunately, resistance is a major obstacle in the clinical management of NPC patients. We prove that the expression level of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is dramatically increased in resistant NPC cells than that in sensitive cells. HMGB1 induces the expression and secretion of IL6, which leads to constitutive autocrine activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and eventually contributes to chemoresistance in NPC cells. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as key regulators involved in drug resistance. In this study, using GO analysis of the biological process and differential expression analysis, we find 12 significantly altered IncRNAs in NPC cell lines, which may be involved in regulating gene expression. Furthermore, we determine that elevated lncRNA MIAT level upregulates HMGB1 expression, contributing to cisplatin resistance in NPC cells. We find that the deficiency of the lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1 axis, inhibition of JAK2/STAT3, or neutralization of IL6 by antibodies significantly re-sensitizes resistant NPC cells to cisplatin in resistant NPC cells. Moreover, we provide the <i>in vivo</i> evidence that the deficiency of HMGB1 reduces cisplatin-resistant tumor growth. Most importantly, we provide clinical evidence showing that the expression level of the lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1/IL6 axis is elevated in resistant NPC tumors, which is highly correlated with poor clinical outcome. Our findings identify a novel chemoresistance mechanism regulated by the lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1/IL6 axis, which indicates the possibilities for lncRNA MIAT, HMGB1, and IL6 as biomarkers for chemoresistance and targets for developing novel strategies to overcome resistance in NPC patients.	2021	lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1 Axis Is Involved in Cisplatin Resistance <i>via</i> Regulating IL6-Mediated Activation of the JAK2/STAT3 Pathway in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.	34094941	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

Women appear more susceptible to cigarette smoke, and often develop more severe lung disease at an earlier age with less smoke exposure. We aimed to analyse whether there are sex differences in DNA methylation in lung tissue and whether these DNA methylation marks interact with smoking. We collected lung tissue samples from former smokers who underwent lung tissue resection. One hundred thirty samples from white subjects were included for this analysis. Regression models for sex as a predictor of methylation were adjusted for age, presence of COPD, smoking variables and technical batch variables revealed 710 associated sites. 294 sites demonstrated robust sex-specific methylation associations in foetal lung tissue. Pathway analysis identified 6 nominally significant pathways including the mitophagy pathway. Three CpG sites demonstrated a suggested interaction between sex and pack-years of smoking: GPR132, ANKRD44 and C19orf60. All of them were nominally significant in both male- and female-specific models, and the effect estimates were in opposite directions for male and female; GPR132 demonstrated significant association between DNA methylation and gene expression in lung tissue (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Sex-specific associations with DNA methylation in lung tissue are wide-spread and may reveal genes and pathways relevant to sex differences for lung damaging effects of cigarette smoking.	2021	Sex-specific associations with DNA methylation in lung tissue demonstrate smoking interactions.	32962511	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play crucial roles in tumor biology and immunology. However, lncRNA-immune interactions have not yet examined in prostate cancer. Here, we performed integrated analysis to characterize lncRNA-immune interactions in prostate cancer through multidimensional aspects, including immune-related hallmarks, tumor immunogenomic signatures, immune-related biological processes, immune cells, and immune checkpoints. We dissected the dysregulation of lncRNAs and their clinical relevance in prostate cancer, such as RP11-627G23.1 and RP11-465N4.5. Immune-related hallmarks took up the major parts among top significant lncRNA-hallmark interactions. Our analysis revealed that TGF-β signaling pathway was the most frequent to associate with lncRNAs, which is a signature of immune response in cancer. In addition, immune response and its regulation were the most closely connected immunological processes with lncRNA, implying the regulatory roles of lncRNAs on immune response in prostate cancer. We found that memory resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were the most lncRNA-correlated immune cell. LINC00861 was found to be potentially intervening targets of immunotherapy for prostate cancer patients, which was significantly associated with PD-1 and CTLA4.

Immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) participates in tumor immune tolerance and promotes tumor progression, while the study of IDO1 in OS is limited. <b>Methods:</b> Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to test the expression of IDO1 and Ki67. The relationship between IDO1 or Ki67 positive count and clinical stage of the patient was analyzed. Laboratory test indexes including serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) at diagnosis of OS patients were collected. The relationship between positive count of IDO1 and Ki67 or laboratory test indexes was analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis. IDO1 stably overexpressed cell lines of these cells (MG63 OE, 143B OE and hFOB1.19 OE) were constructed and validated by Western blot and Elisa. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned culture media of these cells and were identified by Zetaview nanoparticle tracking analyzer. Next-generation sequencing was conducted to identify miRNAs enriched in exosomes. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were verified in clinical samples and cell lines by qPCR. Biological processes and cell components analysis of DE miRNAs was conducted by GO enrichment analysis using the protein interaction network database. <b>Results:</b> Immunosuppressive enzyme IDO1 was highly expressed in tumor tissues. 66.7% (6/9) of the tissues showed moderately or strongly positive immunostaining signal of IDO1, and 33.3% (3/9) were weakly positive. The expression of IDO1 was positively related to Ki67 and associated with prognostic-related clinical features of OS patients. Overexpression of IDO1 significantly affected the exosome-derived miRNA subsets from MG63, 143B and hFOB1.19 cells. A total of 1244 DE miRNAs were identified, and hsa-miR-23a-3p was further screened as key DE miRNA involved in the progression of OS. GO analysis of target genes of the DE miRNA results showed that target enrichment in the functions of immune regulation and tumor progression. <b>Discussion:</b> Our results indicate that IDO1 has the potential to promote the progression of OS that is related to miRNAs mediated tumor immunity.

PMC7378647	10.7150/ijbs.45457	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths globally, is characterized by rapid growth and high invasiveness. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in the growth and metastasis of HCC. Recently, lncRNA LINC01123 has been found to contribute to cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis in lung cancer. However, the function of LINC01123 in HCC, as well as the underlying mechanism of its action, remain unclear. Here, we found that the expression of LINC01123 was clearly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to nontumor tissues. Furthermore, expression of LINC01123 in HCC cells was significantly higher than in LO2 cells. Importantly, the upregulated level of LINC01123 was related to unfavorable clinical features and poor prognosis of HCC. Next, we demonstrated that LINC01123 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells <i>in vitro</i>. Depletion of LINC01123 inhibited HCC xenograft growth <i>in vivo</i>. Conversely, ectopic expression of LINC01123 facilitated HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Mechanistically, LINC01123 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-34a-5p in HCC cells. Tuftelin1 (TUFT1) was identified as the target gene of miR-34a-5p. LINC01123 positively regulated TUFT1 level by targeting of miR-34a-5p in HCC cells. Notably, TUFT1 restoration can abolish miR-34a-5p-induced inhibitory effects on HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In conclusion, LINC01123 was overexpressed in HCC and accelerated cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the miR-34a-5p/TUFT1 axis.	2020	Long noncoding RNA LINC01123 promotes the proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by modulating the miR-34a-5p/TUFT1 axis.	32760198	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC7003030	10.3892/mmr.2020.10930	At present, the association between prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs is yet to be reported in multiple myeloma (MM). The aim of the present study was to construct prognostic models with lncRNAs and mRNAs, and to map the interactions between these lncRNAs and mRNAs in MM. LncRNA and mRNA data from 559 patients with MM were acquired from the Genome Expression Omnibus (dataset GSE24080), and their prognostic values were calculated using the survival package in R. Multivariate Cox analysis was used on the top 20 most significant prognosis‑associated mRNAs and lncRNAs to develop prognostic signatures. The performances of these prognostic signatures were tested using the survivalROC package in R, which allows for time‑dependent receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve estimation. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to investigate the associations between lncRNAs and mRNAs, and a lncRNA‑mRNA network was constructed using Cytoscape software. Univariate Cox regression analysis identified 39 lncRNAs and 1,445 mRNAs that were significantly associated with event‑free survival of MM patients. The top 20 most significant survival‑associated lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected as candidates for analyzing independent MM prognostic factors. Both signatures could be used to separate patients into two groups with distinct outcomes. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.739 for the lncRNA signature and 0.732 for the mRNA signature. In the lncRNA‑mRNA network, a total of 143 mRNAs were positively or negatively associated with 23 prognosis‑associated lncRNAs. NCRNA00201, LOC115110 and RP5‑968J1.1 were the most dominant drivers. The present study constructed a model that predicted prognosis in MM and formed a network with the corresponding prognosis‑associated mRNAs, providing a novel perspective for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of MM, and suggesting novel directions for interpreting the mechanisms underlying the development of MM.	2020	Construction of a prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNA‑mRNA network for multiple myeloma based on microarray and bioinformatics analysis.	32016443	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC6839572	10.2147/ott.s227122	Primary cardiac diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PC-DLBCL) is a rare kind of hematological malignancy, and its clinical and pathologic characteristics, especially in Eastern countries, remain unclear. Moreover, genomic alterations in PC-DLBCL have not been studied previously. We describe a case of a 57-year-old man who presented with exertional dyspnoea due to a heart mass in April 2018 and was diagnosed with PC-DLBCL characterized by immunohistochemical markers of the activated B cell (ABC) subtype and double expression of c-MYC and Bcl-2. Mutations in a total of 11 genes-TBL1XR1, CD79B, IGLL5, ZMYM3, MYD88, TMSB4X, PIM1, BTK, NRXN3, CUX1, and CSMD1-were detected via next-generation sequencing (NGS), while 19 copy number variations (CNVs) such as 1q+, 3p+, 3q+(*2), 5p+, 6p-, 6q-, 7q+, +11, 12q-, 15q-, 17q+, 17p-, +18, 19q+, 19p-, 19q-, X q+, and -Y and 4 copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) lesions located at 1q21.1q44, 3p26.3q11.2, 3q13.11q29 and 6p22.2p21.32 were identified by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping. Some key gene alterations in lymphoma, such as PRDM1 deletion and Bcl-2 amplification, were identified using SNP array analysis. The patient received 6 courses of chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, R-CHOP regimen) after surgery and is currently in remission. In summary, the present case was diagnosed as PC-DLBCL, ABC subtype by the Hans algorithm and double expression lymphoma, with co-occurrence of the MYD88L265P and CD79B mutations (MCD) subtype by genetic alteration analysis. This study presents a unique PC-DLBCL case in which complex genomic alterations were revealed by NGS and SNP array analysis, which has never been reported in the literature, and these findings could provide new insight into the genomic characterization of PC-DLBCL.	2019	Genomic Alterations In Primary Cardiac Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: A Case Report And Literature Review.	31806993	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8474442	10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100227	<h4>Background</h4>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with abnormal tau and amyloid-β accumulation in the brain, leading to neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and extracellular amyloid-β plaques. Treatment is limited to symptom management, a disease-modifying therapy is not available. To advance search of therapy approaches, there is a continued need to identify targets for disease intervention both by confirming existing hypotheses and generating new hypotheses.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a mRNA-seq study to identify genes associated with AD in post-mortem brain samples from the superior temporal gyrus (STG, n ​= ​76), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, n ​= ​65) brain regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified correcting for gender and surrogate variables to capture hidden variation not accounted for by pre-planned covariates. The results from this study were compared with the transcriptome studies from the Accelerated Medicine Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) initiative. Over-representation and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify disease-associated pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analyses were carried out and co-expressed gene modules and their hub genes were identified and associated with additional phenotypic traits of interest.<h4>Results</h4>Several hundred mRNAs were differentially expressed between AD cases and cognitively normal controls in the STG, while no and few transcripts met the same criteria (adjusted p less than 0.05 and fold change greater than 1.2) in the IFG. The findings were consistent at the gene set level with two out of three cohorts from AMP-AD. PPI analysis suggested that the DEGs were enriched in protein-protein interactions than expected by random chance. Over-representation and GSEA analysis suggested genes playing roles in neuroinflammation, amyloid-β, autophagy and trafficking being important for the AD disease process. At the gene level, 10 genes from the STG that were consistently differentially expressed in this study and in the MSBB study (one of the three cohorts within the AMP-AD initiative) were enriched in microglial genes (TREM2, C3AR1, ITGAX, OLR1, CD74, and HLA-DRA), but also included genes with a broader cell type expression pattern such as CDK2AP1. Among the DEGs with supporting evidence from an independent study, CDK2AP1 (most abundantly expressed in astrocyte) was the transcript with strongest association with antemortem cognitive measure (last Mini-Mental State Examination score) and neurofibril tangle burden but also associated with amyloid plaque burden, while OLR1 was the transcript with strongest association with amyloid plaque burden. GSEA and over-representation analyses revealed gene sets related to immune processes including neutrophil degranulation, interleukin 10 signaling, and interferon gamma signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, phagosome and neurotransmitter receptors and postsynaptic signal transmission were enriched from this study and replicated in an independent study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identified differential gene sets, common with two out of three AMP-AD cohorts (ROSMAP and MSBB) and highlights microglia and astrocyte as the key cell-types with DGEs associated with AD clinical diagnosis, and/or antemortem cognitive measure as well as neuropathological indices. Future meta-analysis and causal inferential analysis will be helpful in pinpointing the most relevant pathways and genes to intervene.	2021	Differentially expressed genes in Alzheimer's disease highlighting the roles of microglia genes including OLR1 and astrocyte gene CDK2AP1.	34589742	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC7415429	10.7150/ijbs.46822	MiR-216a-5p has opposite effects on tumorigenesis and progression in the context of different tumors, acting as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene. However, the expression and function of miR-216a-5p in pancreatic cancer (PC) is not well characterized. In this study, we found miR-216a-5p was significantly downregulated in PC tissues and cell lines, which showed a negative correlation with peripancreatic lymph, perineural invasion and TNM stage of PCs patients. We made use of functional assays to reveal that miR-216a-5p inhibited growth and migration of PC cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Then, by employing the bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated TPT1 was a potential target of miR-216a-5p, which contributes to tumor malignance by mediating mTORC1 pathway-associated autophagy. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis and RNA pulldown confirmed that miR-216a-5p was mediated by LINC01133, which sponge miR-216a-5p, as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Collectively, our study revealed an important role of LINC01133/miR-216a-5p/TPT1 axis in the genesis and progression of PCs, which provides potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and therapy of PCs.	2020	MiR-216a-5p inhibits tumorigenesis in Pancreatic Cancer by targeting TPT1/mTORC1 and is mediated by LINC01133.	32792860	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC6636172	10.1186/s41065-019-0101-0	<h4>Background</h4>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be caused by multiple factors, meanwhile the pathogenic mechanism and development of AD associate closely with genetic factors. Existing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD remains incomplete.<h4>Methods</h4>Gene expression data (GSE48350) derived from post-modern brain was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were derived from hippocampus and entorhinal cortex regions between AD patients and healthy controls and detected via Morpheus. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses of DEGs, were performed via Cytoscape and followed by the construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Hub proteins were screened using the criteria: nodes degree≥10 (for hippocampus tissues) and ≥ 8 (for entorhinal cortex tissues). Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to filtrate the important clusters. University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and the database of RNA-binding protein specificities (RBPDB) were employed to identify the RNA-binding proteins of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).<h4>Results</h4>251 & 74 genes were identified as DEGs, which consisted of 56 & 16 up-regulated genes and 195 & 58 down-regulated genes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, respectively. Biological analyses demonstrated that the biological processes and pathways related to memory, transmembrane transport, synaptic transmission, neuron survival, drug metabolism, ion homeostasis and signal transduction were enriched in these genes. 11 genes were identified as hub genes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and 3 hub genes were identified as the novel candidates involved in the pathology of AD. Furthermore, 3 lncRNAs were filtrated, whose binding proteins were closely associated with AD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through GO enrichment analyses, pathway analyses and PPI analyses, we showed a comprehensive interpretation of the pathogenesis of AD at a systematic biology level, and 3 novel candidate genes and 3 lncRNAs were identified as novel and potential candidates participating in the pathology of AD. The results of this study could supply integrated insights for understanding the pathogenic mechanism underlying AD and potential novel therapeutic targets.	2019	Integrated identification of key genes and pathways in Alzheimer's disease via comprehensive bioinformatical analyses.	31346329	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

The lncRNA LINC00339 was reported to regulate the development of lung cancer or breast cancer. However, whether LINC00339 participates in HCC progression remains unclear. Here, our results showed that LINC00339 was upregulated in HCC. <b>Methods:</b> qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) was used to analyze LINC00339 expression in tumor tissues and cell lines. CCK8 and colony formation assays were used to analyze cell proliferation. Transwell assay was used to analyze cell migration and invasion. Xenograft experiment was used to test tumor growth in vivo. <b>Results:</b> LINC00339 overexpression was correlated with an advanced stage, metastasis, and bad prognosis in HCC patients. Functional investigation showed that LINC00339 knockdown significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, decreased LINC00339 expression inhibited HCC growth in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00339 could interact with miR-1182 to promote SKA1 expression. We also demonstrated that SKA1 acted as an oncogene and SKA1 upregulation reversed the effect of LINC00339 silencing. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results illustrated that the LINC00339/miR-1182/SKA1 axis plays an essential role in HCC progression.	2019	LINC00339 promotes growth and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma by the miR-1182/SKA1 pathway.	31239716	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC7534587	10.1289/ehp6263	<h4>Background</h4>Chronic exposure to arsenic (As), a human toxicant and carcinogen, remains a global public health problem. Health risks persist after As exposure has ended, suggesting epigenetic dysregulation as a mechanistic link between exposure and health outcomes.<h4>Objectives</h4>We investigated the association between total urinary As and locus-specific DNA methylation in the Strong Heart Study, a cohort of American Indian adults with low-to-moderate As exposure [total urinary As, mean (±SD) μg/g creatinine: 11.7 (10.6)].<h4>Methods</h4>DNA methylation was measured in 2,325 participants using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. We implemented linear models to test differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and the DMRcate method to identify regions (DMRs) and conducted gene ontology enrichment analysis. Models were adjusted for estimated cell type proportions, age, sex, body mass index, smoking, education, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and study center. Arsenic was measured in urine as the sum of inorganic and methylated species.<h4>Results</h4>In adjusted models, methylation at 20 CpGs was associated with urinary As after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR< 0.05). After Bonferroni correction, 5 CpGs remained associated with total urinary As (pBonferroni<0.05), located in <i>SLC7A11</i>, <i>ANKS3</i>, <i>LINGO3</i>, <i>CSNK1D</i>, <i>ADAMTSL4</i>. We identified one DMR on chromosome 11 (chr11:2,322,050-2,323,247), annotated to <i>C11orf2</i>; <i>TSPAN32</i> genes.<h4>Discussion</h4>This is one of the first epigenome-wide association studies to investigate As exposure and locus-specific DNA methylation using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array and the largest epigenome-wide study of As exposure. The top DMP was located in <i>SLC7A11A</i>, a gene involved in cystine/glutamate transport and the biosynthesis of glutathione, an antioxidant that may protect against As-induced oxidative stress. Additional DMPs were located in genes associated with tumor development and glucose metabolism. Further research is needed, including research in more diverse populations, to investigate whether As-related DNA methylation signatures are associated with gene expression or may serve as biomarkers of disease development. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6263.	2020	Locus-Specific Differential DNA Methylation and Urinary Arsenic: An Epigenome-Wide Association Study in Blood among Adults with Low-to-Moderate Arsenic Exposure.	32603190	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

However, the roles of cancer specific lncRNA and its related competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network in hepatocellular cell carcinoma (HCC) are not fully understood. The lncRNA profiles in 372 HCC patients, including 372 tumor and 48 adjacent non-tumor liver tissues, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCBI GEO omnibus (GSE65485) were analyzed. Cancer specific lncRNAs (or HCC related lncRNAs) were identified and correlated with clinical features. Based on bioinformatics generated from miRcode, starBase, and miRTarBase, we constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network) in HCC. We found 177 cancer specific lncRNAs in HCC (fold change ≥ 1.5, P < 0.01), 41 of them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade, AJCC tumor stage, and AJCC TNM staging system. Six lncRNAs (CECR7, LINC00346, MAPKAPK5-AS1, LOC338651, FLJ90757, and LOC283663) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS, log-rank P < 0.05).

PMC6591245	10.1038/s41420-019-0190-6	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a class of epigenetic regulators implicated in a number of physiological and pathological conditions. Herein, we characterized the lncRNA expression portrait from 837 patients with invasive breast cancer and 105 normals from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), which revealed eighteen upregulated and forty-six downregulated lncRNAs. Clustering analysis revealed distinct lncRNA profile for the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and normal breast tissue, while less separation was observed among the HER2+HR+, HER2+HR-, HER2-HR+ molecular subtypes. LINC01614, and LINC01235 correlated with worse disease-free survival (DFS), while the expression of lnc-LRR1-1, lnc-ODF3B-2, AC015712.5, lnc-LAMB3-1, lnc-SPP2-3, and lnc-MAP9-2 correlated with better DFS. The expression of LINC01235 correlated with worse overall survival (OS), while the expression of MIR205HG, lnc-MAP2K6-5, FGF14-AS2, lnc-SPP2-3 correlated with better OS. Highest expression of LINC01614 was observed in progesterone receptor (PR)+, Estrogen receptor (PR)+, and HER2+ tumors, while lowest expression was in TNBC. Concordantly, LINC01614 was highly expressed in the luminalB/HER2+ subtype from the SRP062132 dataset. Elevated expression of LINC01614 was subsequently validated in primary breast cancer tissue and breast cancer cell lines. Bioinformatics and pathway analyses on LINC01614high vs. LINC01614low BC tissue revealed TGFβ1 and ECM as the most activated networks in LINC01614high tumors. Concordantly, strong correlation between the expression of LINC01614 and COL10A1 (R 2 = 0.6929), SPOCK1 (R 2 = 0.5156), ZEB1 (R 2 = 0.3372), TGFBI (R 2 = 0.2978), TGFB1 (R 2 = 0.1985), ACTA2 (R 2 = 0.1833), and TAGLN (R 2 = 0.1909) was observed. Mechanistically, exogenous TGFB1 induced LINC01614 expression in the BT474 triple positive BC model, while small-molecule inhibition of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ, SB-431542) or focal adhesion kinase (FAK, PF-573228) abrogated LINC01614 expression. Our data revealed the lncRNA transcription landscape in breast cancer and its molecular subtypes. Our data provide novel insight implicating LINC01614 as unfavorable prognostic marker in BC, its association with the HR+/HER2+ BC molecular subtype and its regulation by TGFβ and FAK signaling.	2019	Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptional landscape in breast cancer identifies LINC01614 as non-favorable prognostic biomarker regulated by TGFβ and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling.	31263577	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

As documented in cancer-related literatures, LINC00992 expression is associated with cancer progression, whereas its function in tumors including prostate cancer has not been characterized yet.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from GEPIA database suggested LINC00992 expression in prostate cancer tissues. The expression levels of RNAs were monitored via qRT-PCR. Western blot evaluated the levels of proteins. The proliferation, apoptosis and migration of prostate cancer cells were assessed by CCK-8, EdU, TUNEL, Transwell and wound healing assays. Luciferase reporter, RNA pull down and RIP assays were applied to detect the interplays among LINC00992, miR-3935 and GOLM1.<h4>Results</h4>Elevated levels of LINC00992 and GOLM1 were detected in prostate cancer tissues and cells. LINC00992 exerted facilitating functions in prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration. Mechanically, LINC00992 interacted with and negatively regulated miR-3935 to elevate GOLM1 expression in prostate cancer cells. In addition, the in vitro suppressive effect of silenced LINC00992 on prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration was reversed by GOLM1 upregulation. Likewise, LINC00992 depletion restrained tumor growth in vivo was offset by enhanced GOLM1 expression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LINC00992 competitively bound with miR-3935 to elevate GOLM1 expression and therefore facilitate the oncogenic phenotypes of prostate cancer cells, implying a potential LINC00992-targeted therapy for prostate cancer.	2020	LINC00992 contributes to the oncogenic phenotypes in prostate cancer via targeting miR-3935 and augmenting GOLM1 expression.	32781986	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC6668488	10.3389/fgene.2019.00676	Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element, which also causes neurotoxicity in exposed occupational workers. Mn causes mitochondrial toxicity; however, little is known about transcriptional responses discriminated by physiological and toxicological levels of Mn. Identification of such mechanisms could provide means to evaluate risk of Mn toxicity and also potential avenues to protect against adverse effects. To study the Mn dose-response effects on transcription, analyzed by RNA-Seq, we used human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed for 5 h to Mn (0 to 100 μM), a time point where no immediate cell death occurred at any of the doses. Results showed widespread effects on abundance of protein-coding genes for metabolism of reactive oxygen species, energy sensing, glycolysis, and protein homeostasis including the unfolded protein response and transcriptional regulation. Exposure to a concentration (10 μM Mn for 5 h) that did not result in cell death after 24-h increased abundance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the protein secretion pathway that function in protein trafficking and cellular homeostasis. These include <i>BET1</i> (Golgi vesicular membrane-trafficking protein), <i>ADAM10</i> (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10), and <i>ARFGAP3</i> (ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 3). In contrast, 5-h exposure to 100 μM Mn, a concentration that caused cell death after 24 h, increased abundance of DEGs for components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Integrated pathway analysis results showed that protein secretion gene set was associated with amino acid metabolites in response to 10 μM Mn, while oxidative phosphorylation gene set was associated with energy, lipid, and neurotransmitter metabolites at 100 μM Mn. These results show that differential effects of Mn occur at a concentration which does not cause subsequent cell death compared to a concentration that causes subsequent cell death. If these responses translate to effects on the secretory pathway and mitochondrial functions <i>in vivo</i>, differential activities of these systems could provide a sensitive basis to discriminate sub-toxic and toxic environmental and occupational Mn exposures.	2019	Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Distinct Responses to Physiologic <i>versus</i> Toxic Manganese Exposure in Human Neuroblastoma Cells.	31396262	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8311531	10.3748/wjg.v27.i26.4045	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a leading cause of cancer related mortality on a global scale. The disease itself is associated with a dismal prognosis, partly due to its silent nature resulting in patients presenting with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. To combat this, there has been an explosion in the last decade of potential candidate biomarkers in the research setting in the hope that a diagnostic biomarker may provide a glimmer of hope in what is otherwise quite a substantial clinical dilemma. Currently, serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 is utilized in the diagnostic work-up of patients diagnosed with PC however this biomarker lacks the sensitivity and specificity associated with a gold-standard marker. In the search for a biomarker that is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PC, there has been a paradigm shift towards a focus on liquid biopsy and the use of diagnostic panels which has subsequently proved to have efficacy in the diagnosis of PC. Currently, promising developments in the field of early detection on PC using diagnostic biomarkers include the detection of microRNA (miRNA) in serum and circulating tumour cells. Both these modalities, although in their infancy and yet to be widely accepted into routine clinical practice, possess merit in the early detection of PC. We reviewed over 300 biomarkers with the aim to provide an in-depth summary of the current state-of-play regarding diagnostic biomarkers in PC (serum, urinary, salivary, faecal, pancreatic juice and biliary fluid).	2021	Biomarkers in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer: Are we closer to finding the golden ticket?	34326612	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC8414682	10.1186/s12920-021-01062-2	<h4>Background</h4>Cardiovascular disease had a global prevalence of 523 million cases and 18.6 million deaths in 2019. The current standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) is coronary angiography. Surprisingly, despite well-established clinical indications, up to 40% of the one million invasive cardiac catheterizations return a result of 'no blockage'. The present studies employed RNA sequencing of whole blood to identify an RNA signature in patients with angiographically confirmed CAD.<h4>Methods</h4>Whole blood RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and analyzed by single-molecule sequencing of RNA (RNAseq) to identify transcripts associated with CAD (TRACs) in a discovery group of 96 patients presenting for elective coronary catheterization. The resulting transcript counts were compared between groups to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).<h4>Results</h4>Surprisingly, 98% of DEGs/TRACs were down-regulated ~ 1.7-fold in patients with mild to severe CAD (> 20% stenosis). The TRACs were independent of comorbid risk factors for CAD, such as sex, hypertension, and smoking. Bioinformatic analysis identified an enrichment in transcripts such as FoxP1, ICOSLG, IKZF4/Eos, SMYD3, TRIM28, and TCF3/E2A that are likely markers of regulatory T cells (Treg), consistent with known reductions in Tregs in CAD. A validation cohort of 80 patients confirmed the overall pattern (92% down-regulation) and supported many of the Treg-related changes. TRACs were enriched for transcripts associated with stress granules, which sequester RNAs, and ciliary and synaptic transcripts, possibly consistent with changes in the immune synapse of developing T cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These studies identify a novel mRNA signature of a Treg-like defect in CAD patients and provides a blueprint for a diagnostic test for CAD. The pattern of changes is consistent with stress-related changes in the maturation of T and Treg cells, possibly due to changes in the immune synapse.	2021	RNA sequencing of blood in coronary artery disease: involvement of regulatory T cell imbalance.	34479557	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC6036478	10.3892/ol.2018.8860	Colorectal cancer is a severe cancer associated with a high prevalence and fatality rate. There are three major mechanisms for colorectal cancer: (1) Chromosome instability (CIN), (2) CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and (3) mismatch repair (MMR), of which CIN is the most common type. However, these subtypes are not exclusive and overlap. To investigate their biological mechanisms and cross talk, the gene expression profiles of 585 colorectal cancer patients with CIN, CIMP and MMR status records were collected. By comparing the CIN+ and CIN-samples, CIMP+ and CIMP-samples, MMR+ and MMR-samples with minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) and incremental feature selection (IFS) methods, the CIN, CIMP and MMR associated genes were selected. Unfortunately, there was little direct overlap among them. To investigate their indirect interactions, downstream genes of CIN, CIMP and MMR were identified using the random walk with restart (RWR) method and a greater overlap of downstream genes was indicated. The common downstream genes were involved in biosynthetic and metabolic pathways. These findings were consistent with the clinical observation of wide range metabolite aberrations in colorectal cancer. To conclude, the present study gave a gene level explanation of CIN, CIMP and MMR, but also showed the network level cross talk of CIN, CIMP and MMR. The common genes of CIN, CIMP and MMR may be useful for cross-subtype general colorectal cancer drug development.	2018	Cross talk of chromosome instability, CpG island methylator phenotype and mismatch repair in colorectal cancer.	30008861	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC5667849	10.1371/journal.pone.0187457	RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays are methods for measuring gene expression across the entire transcriptome. Recent advances have made these techniques practical and affordable for essentially any laboratory with experience in molecular biology. A variety of computational methods have been developed to decrease the amount of bioinformatics expertise necessary to analyze these data. Nevertheless, many barriers persist which discourage new labs from using functional genomics approaches. Since high-quality gene expression studies have enduring value as resources to the entire research community, it is of particular importance that small labs have the capacity to share their analyzed datasets with the research community. Here we introduce ExpressionDB, an open source platform for visualizing RNA-seq and microarray data accommodating virtually any number of different samples. ExpressionDB is based on Shiny, a customizable web application which allows data sharing locally and online with customizable code written in R. ExpressionDB allows intuitive searches based on gene symbols, descriptions, or gene ontology terms, and it includes tools for dynamically filtering results based on expression level, fold change, and false-discovery rates. Built-in visualization tools include heatmaps, volcano plots, and principal component analysis, ensuring streamlined and consistent visualization to all users. All of the scripts for building an ExpressionDB with user-supplied data are freely available on GitHub, and the Creative Commons license allows fully open customization by end-users. We estimate that a demo database can be created in under one hour with minimal programming experience, and that a new database with user-supplied expression data can be completed and online in less than one day.	2017	ExpressionDB: An open source platform for distributing genome-scale datasets.	29095940	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC6730898	10.1371/journal.pone.0221476	BACKGROUND:Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) is one of the major cancers worldwide, responsible for millions of premature deaths every year. Prediction of clinical staging is vital to implement optimal therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction in cancer patients. However, to date, no method has been developed for predicting the stage of LIHC from the genomic profile of samples. METHODS:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of 173 early stage (stage-I), 177 late stage (stage-II, Stage-III and stage-IV) and 50 adjacent normal tissue samples for 60,483 RNA transcripts and 485,577 methylation CpG sites, was extensively analyzed to identify the key transcriptomic expression and methylation-based features using different feature selection techniques. Further, different classification models were developed based on selected key features to categorize different classes of samples implementing different machine learning algorithms. RESULTS:In the current study, in silico models have been developed for classifying LIHC patients in the early vs. late stage and cancerous vs. normal samples using RNA expression and DNA methylation data. TCGA datasets were extensively analyzed to identify differentially expressed RNA transcripts and methylated CpG sites that can discriminate early vs. late stages and cancer vs. normal samples of LIHC with high precision. Naive Bayes model developed using 51 features that combine 21 CpG methylation sites and 30 RNA transcripts achieved maximum MCC (Matthew's correlation coefficient) 0.58 with an accuracy of 78.87% on the validation dataset in discrimination of early and late stage. Additionally, the prediction models developed based on 5 RNA transcripts and 5 CpG sites classify LIHC and normal samples with an accuracy of 96-98% and AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) 0.99. Besides, multiclass models also developed for classifying samples in the normal, early and late stage of cancer and achieved an accuracy of 76.54% and AUC of 0.86. CONCLUSION:Our study reveals stage prediction of LIHC samples with high accuracy based on the genomics and epigenomics profiling is a challenging task in comparison to the classification of cancerous and normal samples. Comprehensive analysis, differentially expressed RNA transcripts, methylated CpG sites in LIHC samples and prediction models are available from CancerLSP (http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cancerlsp/).	2019	Classification of early and late stage liver hepatocellular carcinoma patients from their genomics and epigenomics profiles.	31490960	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC5106035	10.1371/journal.pgen.1006427	Thousands of regions in gametes have opposing methylation profiles that are largely resolved during the post-fertilization epigenetic reprogramming. However some specific sequences associated with imprinted loci survive this demethylation process. Here we present the data describing the fate of germline-derived methylation in humans. With the exception of a few known paternally methylated germline differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with known imprinted domains, we demonstrate that sperm-derived methylation is reprogrammed by the blastocyst stage of development. In contrast a large number of oocyte-derived methylation differences survive to the blastocyst stage and uniquely persist as transiently methylated DMRs only in the placenta. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is exclusive to primates, since no placenta-specific maternal methylation was observed in mouse. Utilizing single cell RNA-seq datasets from human preimplantation embryos we show that following embryonic genome activation the maternally methylated transient DMRs can orchestrate imprinted expression. However despite showing widespread imprinted expression of genes in placenta, allele-specific transcriptional profiling revealed that not all placenta-specific DMRs coordinate imprinted expression and that this maternal methylation may be absent in a minority of samples, suggestive of polymorphic imprinted methylation.	2016	Human Oocyte-Derived Methylation Differences Persist in the Placenta Revealing Widespread Transient Imprinting.	27835649	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC5355991	10.1038/srep44547	Sex differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders are well documented, with exposure to stress during gestation differentially impacting females and males. We explored sex-specific DNA methylation in the cord blood of 39 females and 32 males born at term and with appropriate weight at birth regarding their potential connection to psychiatric outcomes. Mothers were interviewed to gather information about environmental factors (gestational exposure) that could interfere with the methylation profiles in the newborns. Bisulphite converted DNA was hybridized to Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Excluding XYS probes, there were 2,332 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMSs) between sexes, which were enriched within brain modules of co-methylated CpGs during brain development and also differentially methylated in the brains of boys and girls. Genes associated with the DMSs were enriched for neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly for CpG sites found differentially methylated in brain tissue between patients with schizophrenia and controls. Moreover, the DMS had an overlap of 890 (38%) CpG sites with a cohort submitted to toxic exposition during gestation. This study supports the evidences that sex differences in DNA methylation of autosomes act as a primary driver of sex differences that are found in psychiatric outcomes.	2017	Sex differences in DNA methylation of the cord blood are related to sex-bias psychiatric diseases.	28303968	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC6328509	10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.06.08	<h4>Objective</h4>Liver metastasis, which contributes substantially to high mortality, is the most common recurrent mode of colon carcinoma. Thus, it is necessary to identify genes implicated in metastatic colonization of the liver in colon carcinoma.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared mRNA profiling in 18 normal colon mucosa (N), 20 primary tumors (T) and 19 liver metastases (M) samples from the dataset GSE49355 and GSE62321 of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene ontology (GO) and pathways of the identified genes were analyzed. Co-expression network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were employed to identify the interaction relationship. Survival analyses based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to further screening. Then, the candidate genes were validated by our data.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 22 specific genes related to liver metastasis and they were strongly associated with cell migration, adhesion, proliferation and immune response. Simultaneously, the results showed that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) might be a favorable prediction factor for survival of patients with colon carcinoma. Importantly, our validated data further suggested that lower CXCL14 represented poorer outcome and contributed to metastasis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that CXCL14 was negatively related to the regulation of stem cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).<h4>Conclusions</h4>CXCL14 was identified as a crucial anti-metastasis regulator of colon carcinoma for the first time, and might provide novel therapeutic strategies for colon carcinoma patients to improve prognosis and prevent metastasis.	2018	Identification of liver metastasis-associated genes in human colon carcinoma by mRNA profiling.	30700932	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC6781370	10.1186/s40478-019-0797-0	The majority of the clinico-pathological variability observed in patients harboring a repeat expansion in the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex subunit (C9orf72) remains unexplained. This expansion, which represents the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND), results in a loss of C9orf72 expression and the generation of RNA foci and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. The C9orf72 protein itself plays a role in vesicular transport, serving as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates GTPases. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying C9orf72-related diseases and to identify potential disease modifiers, we performed an extensive RNA sequencing study. We included individuals for whom frontal cortex tissue was available: FTLD and FTLD/MND patients with (n = 34) or without (n = 44) an expanded C9orf72 repeat as well as control subjects (n = 24). In total, 6706 genes were differentially expressed between these groups (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). The top gene was C9orf72 (FDR = 1.41E-14), which was roughly two-fold lower in C9orf72 expansion carriers than in (disease) controls. Co-expression analysis revealed groups of correlated genes (modules) that were enriched for processes such as protein folding, RNA splicing, synaptic signaling, metabolism, and Golgi vesicle transport. Within our cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, machine learning uncovered interesting candidates associated with clinico-pathological features, including age at onset (vascular endothelial growth factor A [VEGFA]), C9orf72 expansion size (cyclin dependent kinase like 1 [CDKL1]), DPR protein levels (eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase [EEF2K]), and survival after onset (small G protein signaling modulator 3 [SGSM3]). Given the fact that we detected a module involved in vesicular transport in addition to a GTPase activator (SGSM3) as a potential modifier, our findings seem to suggest that the presence of a C9orf72 repeat expansion might hamper vesicular transport and that genes affecting this process may modify the phenotype of C9orf72-linked diseases.	2019	Extensive transcriptomic study emphasizes importance of vesicular transport in C9orf72 expansion carriers.	31594549	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC9877488	10.7759/cureus.32980	<h4>Introduction</h4>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) due to its ability to spread inflammatory proteins throughout the nervous system. We hypothesized that filtration of the CSF could remove pathogenic proteins and prevent them from altering motor phenotypes in a mouse model.<h4>Methods</h4>We filtered the CSF from 11 ALS patients via 100 kilodaltons (kD) molecular weight cut-off filters. We used mass spectrometry-based discovery proteomics workflows to compare protein abundances before and after filtration. To test the effects of CSF filtration on motor function, we injected groups of mice with saline, filtered ALS-CSF, or unfiltered ALS-CSF (n=12 per group) and assessed motor function via pole descent and open field tests.<h4>Results</h4>We identified proteins implicated in ALS pathogenesis and showed that these were removed in significant amounts in our workflow. Key filtered proteins included complement proteins, chitinases, serine protease inhibitors, and neuro-inflammatory proteins such as amyloid precursor protein, chromogranin A, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Compared to the filtered ALS-CSF mice, unfiltered ALS-CSF mice took longer to descend a pole (10 days post-injection, 11.14 seconds vs 14.25 seconds, p = 0.02) and explored less on an open field (one day post-injection, 21.81 m vs 16.83 m, p = 0.0004).<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated the ability to filter proteins from the CSF of ALS patients and identified potentially pathologic proteins that were reduced in quantity. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability of unfiltered ALS-CSF to induce motor deficits in mice on the pole descent and open field tests and showed that filtration could prevent this deficit. Given the lack of effective treatments for ALS, this could be a novel solution for patients suffering from this deadly and irreversible condition.	2022	Filtered Cerebrospinal Fluid From Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Displays an Altered Proteome and Affects Motor Phenotype in a Mouse Model.	36712738	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol
PMC5311031	10.1038/onc.2016.279	Recurrent mutations in core splicing factors have been reported in several clonal disorders, including cancers. Mutations in SF3B1, a component of the U2 splicing complex, are the most common. SF3B1 mutations are associated with aberrant pre-mRNA splicing using cryptic 3' splice sites (3'SSs), but the mechanism of their selection is not clear. To understand how cryptic 3'SSs are selected, we performed comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide changes to splicing and gene expression associated with SF3B1 mutations in patient samples as well as an experimental model of inducible expression. Hundreds of cryptic 3'SS were detectable across the genome in cells expressing mutant SF3B1. These 3'SS are typically sequestered within RNA secondary structures and poorly accessible compared with their corresponding canonical 3'SS. We hypothesized that these cryptic 3'SS are inaccessible during normal splicing catalysis and that this constraint is overcome in spliceosomes containing mutant SF3B1. This model of secondary structure-dependent selection of cryptic 3'SS was found across multiple clonal processes associated with SF3B1 mutations (myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia). We validated our model predictions in mini-gene splicing assays. Additionally, we found deregulated expression of proteins with relevant functions in splicing factor-related diseases both in association with aberrant splicing and without corresponding splicing changes. Our results show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with a distinct splicing program shared across multiple clonal processes and define a biochemical mechanism for altered 3'SS choice.	2017	Cancer-associated SF3B1 mutants recognize otherwise inaccessible cryptic 3' splice sites within RNA secondary structures.	27524419	A1BG-AS1	NCRNA00181	primary_symbol

NA	10.1007/s13577-021-00554-8	The dysregulated long non-coding RNA A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) has been implicated in the oncogenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction in this study, we detected A1BG-AS1 expression in breast cancer and elucidated the regulatory functions and exact mechanisms of A1BG-AS1 in breast cancer cells. The regulatory functions of A1BG-AS1 were examined in vitro using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometric, and Transwell migration and invasion assays and in vivo through tumor xenograft experiments. In addition, we performed bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments to verify the interaction among A1BG-AS1, microRNA-485-5p (miR-485-5p), and flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in breast cancer. We found A1BG-AS1 to be highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. In terms of function, depleted A1BG-AS1 markedly suppressed cell proliferation, accelerated cell apoptosis, and hindered cell migration and invasion in breast cancer. Furthermore, A1BG-AS1 interference reduced tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations confirmed that A1BG-AS1 directly interacted with miR-485-5p as a molecular sponge. We demonstrated that FLOT1 is a direct target of miR-485-5p, which could be positively regulated by A1BG-AS1 by competing for miR-485-5p. Rescue experiments clearly showed that the downregulation of miR-485-5p and upregulation of FLOT1 were capable of reversing the anticancer activities of A1BG-AS1 deficiency in terms of breast cancer cell malignancy. A1BG-AS1 acts as a miR-485-5p sponge and subsequently increases FLOT1 expression in breast cancer cells, ultimately facilitating cancer progression. Hence, the A1BG-AS1/miR-485-5p/FLOT1 pathway might offer a novel therapeutic perspective for breast cancer.	2021	Long non-coding RNA A1BG-AS1 promotes tumorigenesis in breast cancer by sponging microRNA-485-5p and consequently increasing expression of FLOT1 expression.	34115333	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
NA	10.1002/jcb.28315	Extensive evidence indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulates the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the expression and biological function of lncRNA A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) were poorly known in HCC. Here, we found the underexpression of A1BG-AS1 in HCC via analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Further analyses confirmed that A1BG-AS1 expression in HCC was markedly lower than that in noncancerous tissues based on our HCC cohort. Clinical association analysis revealed that low A1BG-AS1 expression correlated with poor prognostic features, such as microvascular invasion, high tumor grade, and advanced tumor stage. Follow-up data indicated that low A1BG-AS1 level evidently correlated with poor clinical outcomes of HCC patients. Moreover, forced expression of A1BG-AS1 repressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Conversely, A1BG-AS1 knockdown promoted these malignant behaviors in HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, A1BG-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA by directly sponging miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Notably, miR-216a-5p restoration rescued A1BG-AS1 attenuated proliferation, migration and invasion of HCCLM3 cells. A1BG-AS1 positively regulated the levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog and SMAD family member 7, which were reduced by miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Altogether, we conclude that A1BG-AS1 exerts a tumor suppressive role in HCC progression.	2019	lncRNA A1BG-AS1 suppresses proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting miR-216a-5p.	30556161	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

Cord blood DNA methylation was measured by Illumina HumanMethylation 450K in one subset (N = 189) and EPICarray in another (N = 349). High (vegetation height>3 m (m)), low (vegetation height<3 m) and total (including both) high-resolution green space exposures during pregnancy were estimated within 100 m and 1000 m distance around maternal residence. In each subset, we sought cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites via linear mixed models adjusted on newborns' sex, ethnicity, gestational age, season at delivery, sampling day, maternal parity, age, smoking, education, and estimated blood cell proportions. EWASs results were meta-analysed via fixed-effects meta-analyses. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified via ENmix-combp and DMRcate algorithms. Sensitivity analyses were additionally adjusted on PM<sub>2.5</sub>, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income. In the 450K subset, cord blood expression of differentially methylated genes was measured by Agilent microarrays and associated with green space.<h4>Results</h4>147 DMRs were identified, 85 of which were still significant upon adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income, including HLA-DRB5, RPTOR, KCNQ1DN, A1BG-AS1, HTR2A, ZNF274, COL11A1 and PRSS36 DMRs. One CpG reached genome-wide significance, while 54 CpGs were suggestive significant (p-values<1e-05). Among them, a CpG, hypermethylated with 100 m buffer total green space, was annotated to PAQR9, whose expression decreased with 1000 m buffer low green space (p-value = 1.45e-05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results demonstrate that maternal exposure to green space during pregnancy is associated with cord blood DNA methylation, mainly at loci organized in regions, in genes playing important roles in neurological development (e.g., HTR2A).	2023	Epigenome-wide analysis of maternal exposure to green space during gestation and cord blood DNA methylation in the ENVIRONAGE cohort.	36400229	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

However, the relationship and interaction mechanism between lncRNAs and fatty acid signaling in HCC remain unclear. Data regarding RNA expression and clinical outcomes for patients with HCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), HCCDB, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Hallmark pathways were identified using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method. ConsensusClusterPlus was used to establish a consistency matrix for classifying samples into three subtypes. A risk signature was established, and predictive values for key lncRNAs related to prognosis were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. The ESTIMATE algorithm, MCP-Counter, and ssGSEA were used to evaluate the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment. The CTRP2.0 and PRISM were used to analyze drug sensitivity in HCC subtypes. We discovered seven fatty-acid-associated lncRNAs with predictive prognostic capabilities, including TRAF3IP2-AS1, SNHG10, AL157392.2, LINC02641, AL357079.1, AC046134.2, and A1BG-AS. Three subtypes were obtained, which presented with differences in prognosis, clinical information, mutation features, pathway traits, immune characteristics, and drug sensitivity. The seven key lncRNAs identified in this study might serve as promising biomarkers for predicting prognosis in patients with HCC, and the three HCC subtypes classified according to lncRNA expression profiles could improve HCC classification.	2022	A novel classification of HCC basing on fatty-acid-associated lncRNA.	36344648	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

However, the function of lncRNAs remains poorly understood, especially in the context of infection with low-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs). To further understanding on this issue, we investigated lncRNA expression in HPV-induced common warts.<h4>Methods</h4>A publicly available high-throughput sequencing dataset for common warts was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). lncRNA profiles were generated using the NetworkAnalyst 3.0 workflow, and a list of differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs in common warts was identified and inputted into the ENCODE, RegNetwork, DisGeNet, and miRNet platforms.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 54 lncRNAs were revealed to be significantly dysregulated in common warts. Of these 54 lncRNAs, 24 and 30 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The most significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs in common warts included the <i>CERNA2</i>, <i>LINC02159</i>, <i>SH3PXD2A-AS1</i>, and <i>UNC5B-AS1</i> genes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current findings suggest that HPV-induced warts impact the host lncRNA transcriptome.

Our aim was to develop a metabolism-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signature to assess the prognosis of BC patients in order to optimize treatment. Metabolism-related genes between breast tumors and normal tissues were screened out, and Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate metabolism-related lncRNAs. In total, five metabolism-related lncRNAs were enrolled to establish prognostic signatures. Kaplan-Meier plots and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated good performance in both training and validation groups. Further analysis demonstrated that the signature was an independent prognostic factor for BC. A nomogram incorporating risk score and tumor stage was then constructed to evaluate the 3 - and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with BC. In conclusion, this study identified a metabolism-related lncRNA signature that can predict RFS of BC patients and established a prognostic nomogram that helps guide the individualized treatment of patients at different risks.	2021	Metabolism-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential biomarkers for predicting risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients.	34254565	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

We aimed to identify autophagy-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to elucidate the molecular mechanism of UM. Here, we show that LINC01278 is a new potential biomarker with clinical prognostic value in UM through bioinformatics analysis. Application of an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) and an autophagy agonist (MG-132) indicated that LINC01278 can inhibit UM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inducing autophagy. A xenograft nude mouse model was used to examine the tumorigenesis of UM cells in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC01278 can inhibit the mTOR signalling pathway to activate autophagy, as shown by experiments with an mTOR agonist (MHY1485) and mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) treatment. Our findings indicate that LINC01278 functions as a tumour suppressor by inhibiting the mTOR signalling pathway to induce autophagy. Targeting the LINC01278-mTOR axis might be a novel and promising therapeutic approach for UM.	2023	LINC01278 Induces Autophagy to Inhibit Tumour Progression by Suppressing the mTOR Signalling Pathway.	36713034	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8517989	10.7150/jca.63351	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical drivers and suppressors of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The downregulation of transmembrane protein 220 antisense RNA 1 (TMEM220-AS1) is correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. Nevertheless, the role of TMEM220-AS1 in HCC and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, TMEM220-AS1 levels were markedly reduced in HCC tissues compared with noncancerous tissues. TMEM220-AS1 downregulation was confirmed in HCC cell lines. TMEM220-AS1 expression was associated with tumor stage, venous infiltration, tumor size, and survival of HCC patients. TMEM220-AS1 overexpression suppressed the migration, invasion, and proliferation of HCC cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of TMEM220-AS1 increased TMEM220 levels in HCC cells. Decreased TMEM220 levels were observed in HCC tissues and cell lines. TMEM220 expression was positively correlated with TMEM220-AS1 levels in HCC tissue samples and TMEM220 downregulation was significantly correlated with reduced patient survival. TMEM220 overexpression suppressed HCC cell proliferation and mobility. TMEM220 knockdown eliminated the suppressive effect of TMEM220-AS1 in HCCLM3 cells. Mechanistically, TMEM220 overexpression reduced the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and decreased MYC, Cyclin D1, and Snail1 mRNA levels in HCCLM3 cells. BIO, a GSK3β inhibitor, eliminated TMEM220-induced Wnt/β-catenin pathway inactivation and inhibited HCC cell proliferation and mobility. In conclusion, TMEM220-AS1 and TMEM220 were expressed at low levels in HCC patients. TMEM220-AS1 inhibited the malignant behavior of HCC cells by enhancing TMEM220 expression and subsequently inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.	2021	LncRNA TMEM220-AS1 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the TMEM220/β-catenin axis.	34659569	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC9279027	10.1155/2022/9332844	"<h4>Objective</h4>The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection led to hepatitis, which was one of common reasons for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The immune microenvironment alteration played a crucial role in this process. The study aimed to identify immune-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in HBV-related HCC and explore potential mechanisms.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 1,072 immune-related genes (IRGs) were enriched in different co-expression modules with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) combining the corresponding clinical features in HBV-related HCC. The immune-related lncRNAs were selected from the crucial co-expression model based on the correlation analysis with IRGs. The immune-related lncRNAs were furtherly used to construct prognostic signature by the Cox proportional hazards regression and Lasso regression. Furthermore, the proliferation and migration ability of lncRNA SNHG10 were verified in vitro.<h4>Results</h4>A total of nine co-expression modules were identified by WGCNA of which the ""red"" co-expression module was most correlated with various clinical characteristics. Additionally, the IRGs in this module were significantly enriched in multiple immune-related pathways. The twelve immune-related lncRNAs prognostic signature (HAND2-AS1, LINC00844, SNHG10, MALAT1, LINC00460, LBX2-AS1, MIR31HG, SEMA6A-AS1, LINC1278, LINC00514, CTBP-AS2, and LINC00205) was constructed. The risk score was an independent risk factor in HBV-related HCC and verified by principal components analysis (PCA), nomogram, and PCR between different cell lines. Moreover, the proportion of immune cells were significantly different between high-risk score group and low-risk score group. The malignant behavior of Hep3B was significantly different between si-lncRNA SNHG10 and control group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The immune-related lncRNAs prognostic signature provided some potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in HBV-related HCC."	2022	Immune-Related lncRNAs with WGCNA Identified the Function of SNHG10 in HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	35847362	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

They have a critical role in regulation of cell proliferation and migration. MiRNAs aberrations have been reported in various cancers. Considering the importance of these factors in regulation of cellular processes and their high stability in body fluids, these factors can be suggested as suitable non-invasive markers for the cancer diagnosis. MiR-216a deregulation has been frequently reported in different cancers. Therefore, in the present review we discussed the molecular mechanisms of the miR-216a during tumor progression. It has been reported that miR-216a mainly functioned as a tumor suppressor through the regulation of signaling pathways and transcription factors. This review paves the way to suggest the miR-216a as a probable therapeutic and diagnostic target in cancer patients.	2023	Molecular mechanisms of microRNA-216a during tumor progression.	36740668	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway is a highly complicated web of proteins which work spatio-temporally to regulate multiple steps of carcinogenesis. TGFβ/SMAD has been shown to dualistically regulate cancer progression. Therefore, TGFβ/SMAD signaling behaves as a ""double-edged sword"" in molecular oncology. Accordingly, regulation of TGFβ/SMAD is multi-layered because of oncogenic and tumor suppressor long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs). In this review, we have summarized most recent breakthroughs in our understanding related to regulation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling by lncRNAs. We have comprehensively analyzed how different lncRNAs positively and negatively regulate TGFβ/SMAD signaling in different cancers. We have gathered missing pieces of an incomplete jig-saw puzzle of lncRNA-interactome ranging from ""sponge effects"" of lncRNAs to mechanistic modulation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling by lncRNAs."	2021	Regulation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling by long non-coding RNAs in different cancers: Dark Knight in the Castle of molecular oncology.	33511320	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8195627	10.3389/fonc.2021.665388	<h4>Background</h4>Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is encoded by the solute carrier family 2A1 (SLC2A1) gene and is one of the glucose transporters with the greatest affinity for glucose. Abnormal expression of GLUT1 is associated with a variety of cancers. However, the biological role of GLUT1 in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) remains to be determined.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed the expression of GLUT1 in pan-cancer and ESCA as well as clinicopathological analysis through multiple databases. Use R and STRING to perform GO/KEGG function enrichment and PPI analysis for GLUT1 co-expression. TIMER and CIBERSORT were used to analyze the relationship between GLUT1 expression and immune infiltration in ESCA. The TCGA ESCA cohort was used to analyze the relationship between GLUT1 expression and m6A modification in ESCA, and to construct a regulatory network in line with the ceRNA hypothesis.<h4>Results</h4>GLUT1 is highly expressed in a variety of tumors including ESCA, and is closely related to histological types and histological grade. GO/KEGG functional enrichment analysis revealed that GLUT1 is closely related to structural constituent of cytoskeleton, intermediate filament binding, cell-cell adheres junction, epidermis development, and P53 signaling pathway. PPI shows that GLUT1 is closely related to TP53, GIPC1 and INS, and these three proteins all play an important role in tumor proliferation. CIBERSORT analysis showed that GLUT1 expression is related to the infiltration of multiple immune cells. When GLUT1 is highly expressed, the number of memory B cells decreases. ESCA cohort analysis found that GLUT1 expression was related to 7 m6A modifier genes. Six possible crRNA networks in ESCA were constructed by correlation analysis, and all these ceRNA networks contained GLUT1.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GLUT1 can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of ESCA, and is related to tumor immune infiltration, m6A modification and ceRNA network.	2021	Comprehensive Analysis of GLUT1 Immune Infiltrates and ceRNA Network in Human Esophageal Carcinoma.	34123828	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8669964	10.3389/fcell.2021.781285	There are many types of cancers. Although they share some hallmarks, such as proliferation and metastasis, they are still very different from many perspectives. They grow on different organ or tissues. Does each cancer have a unique gene expression pattern that makes it different from other cancer types? After the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, there are more and more pan-cancer studies. Researchers want to get robust gene expression signature from pan-cancer patients. But there is large variance in cancer patients due to heterogeneity. To get robust results, the sample size will be too large to recruit. In this study, we tried another approach to get robust pan-cancer biomarkers by using the cell line data to reduce the variance. We applied several advanced computational methods to analyze the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) gene expression profiles which included 988 cell lines from 20 cancer types. Two feature selection methods, including Boruta, and max-relevance and min-redundancy methods, were applied to the cell line gene expression data one by one, generating a feature list. Such list was fed into incremental feature selection method, incorporating one classification algorithm, to extract biomarkers, construct optimal classifiers and decision rules. The optimal classifiers provided good performance, which can be useful tools to identify cell lines from different cancer types, whereas the biomarkers (e.g. NCKAP1, TNFRSF12A, LAMB2, FKBP9, PFN2, TOM1L1) and rules identified in this work may provide a meaningful and precise reference for differentiating multiple types of cancer and contribute to the personalized treatment of tumors.	2021	Identification of Pan-Cancer Biomarkers Based on the Gene Expression Profiles of Cancer Cell Lines.	34917619	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC7648293	10.1186/s12967-020-02578-4	<h4>Background</h4>Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that immune-related lncRNAs (IRLs) are commonly aberrantly expressed in breast cancer (BC). Thus, we aimed to establish an IRL-based tool to improve prognosis prediction in BC patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We obtained IRL expression profiles in large BC cohorts (N = 911) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, in light of the correlation between each IRL and recurrence-free survival (RFS), we screened prognostic IRL signatures to construct a novel RFS nomogram via a Cox regression model. Subsequently, the performance of the IRL-based model was evaluated through discrimination, calibration ability, risk stratification ability and decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 52 IRLs were obtained from TCGA. Based on multivariate Cox regression analyses, four IRLs (A1BG-AS1, AC004477.3, AC004585.1 and AC004854.2) and two risk parameters (tumor subtype and TNM stage) were utilized as independent indicators to develop a novel prognostic model. In terms of predictive accuracy, the IRL-based model was distinctly superior to the TNM staging system (AUC: 0.728 VS 0.673, P = 0.010). DCA indicated that our nomogram had favorable clinical practicability. In addition, risk stratification analysis showed that the IRL-based tool efficiently divided BC patients into high- and low-risk groups (P < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel IRL-based model was constructed to predict the risk of 5-year RFS in BC. Our model can improve the predictive power of the TNM staging system and identify high-risk patients with tumor recurrence to implement more appropriate treatment strategies.	2020	Molecular characterization of breast cancer: a potential novel immune-related lncRNAs signature.	33160384	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8178833	10.1186/s12864-020-07289-0	<h4>Background</h4>The development of RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and the corresponding emergence of public datasets have created new avenues of transcriptional marker search. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute an emerging class of transcripts with a potential for high tissue specificity and function. Therefore, we tested the biomarker potential of lncRNAs on Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), a complex type of adult multipotent stem cells of diverse tissue origins, that is frequently used in clinics but which is lacking extensive characterization.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a dedicated bioinformatics pipeline for the purpose of building a cell-specific catalogue of unannotated lncRNAs. The pipeline performs ab initio transcript identification, pseudoalignment and uses new methodologies such as a specific k-mer approach for naive quantification of expression in numerous RNAseq data. We next applied it on MSCs, and our pipeline was able to highlight novel lncRNAs with high cell specificity. Furthermore, with original and efficient approaches for functional prediction, we demonstrated that each candidate represents one specific state of MSCs biology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We showed that our approach can be employed to harness lncRNAs as cell markers. More specifically, our results suggest different candidates as potential actors in MSCs biology and propose promising directions for future experimental investigations.	2021	Long non-coding RNA exploration for mesenchymal stem cell characterisation.	34088266	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8599203	10.1093/cid/ciab216	"Our goal was to identify genetic risk factors for severe otitis media (OM) in Aboriginal Australians. Illumina® Omni2.5 BeadChip and imputed data were compared between 21 children with severe OM (multiple episodes chronic suppurative OM and/or perforations or tympanic sclerosis) and 370 individuals without this phenotype, followed by FUnctional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA). Exome data filtered for common (EXaC_all ≥ 0.1) putative deleterious variants influencing protein coding (CADD-scaled scores ≥15] were used to compare 15 severe OM cases with 9 mild cases (single episode of acute OM recorded over ≥3 consecutive years). Rare (ExAC_all ≤ 0.01) such variants were filtered for those present only in severe OM. Enrichr was used to determine enrichment of genes contributing to pathways/processes relevant to OM. FUMA analysis identified 2 plausible genetic risk loci for severe OM: NR3C1 (Pimputed_1000G = 3.62 × 10-6) encoding the glucocorticoid receptor, and NREP (Pimputed_1000G = 3.67 × 10-6) encoding neuronal regeneration-related protein.

However, there are few comprehensive studies on SLC2A1 in colorectal cancer (CRC). <b>Methods:</b> Oncomine, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were used to analyze the expression of SLC2A1 in pan-cancer and CRC and analyzed the correlation between SLC2A1 expression and clinical characteristics of TCGA CRC samples. The expression level of SLC2A1 in CRC was certified by cell experiments and immunohistochemical staining analysis. The Genome Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analyses of SLC2A1 relative genes were completed by bioinformatics analysis. The correlation between SLC2A1 expression level and CRC immune infiltration cell was analyzed by Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and TCGA database. The correlation between SLC2A1 expression level and ferroptosis and m6A modification of CRC was analyzed by utilizing TCGA and GEO cohort. Finally, the possible competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks involved in SLC2A1 in CRC are predicted and constructed through various databases. <b>Results:</b> SLC2A1 is highly expressed not only in CRC but also in many other tumors. ROC curve indicated that SLC2A1 had high predictive accuracy for the outcomes of tumor. The SLC2A1 expression in CRC was closely correlated with tumor stage and progression free interval (PFI). GO, KEGG, and GSEA analysis indicated that SLC2A1 relative genes were involved in multiple biological functions. The analysis of TIMER, GEPIA, and TCGA database indicated that the SLC2A1 mRNA expression was mainly positively associated with neutrophils. By the analysis of the TCGA and GEO cohort, we identified that the expression of SLC2A1 is closely associated to an m6A modification relative gene Insulin Like Growth Factor 2 MRNA Binding Protein 3 (IGF2BP3) and a ferroptosis relative gene Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4). <b>Conclusion:</b> SLC2A1 can be used as a biomarker of CRC, which is associated to immune infiltration, m6A modification, ferroptosis, and ceRNA regulatory network of CRC.	2022	SLC2A1 is a Diagnostic Biomarker Involved in Immune Infiltration of Colorectal Cancer and Associated With m6A Modification and ceRNA.	35399515	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC7071826	10.7717/peerj.8758	<h4>Background</h4>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis and a high incidence. The molecular changes and novel biomarkers of HCC need to be identified to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. We investigated the current research concentrations of HCC and identified the transcriptomics-related biomarkers of HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) database.<h4>Methods</h4>We investigated the current research concentrations of HCC using literature metrology analysis for studies conducted from 2008 to 2018. We identified long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that correlated with the clinical features and survival prognoses of HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) database. Differentially expressed genes (lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs) were also identified by TCGA datasets in HCC tumor tissues. A lncRNA competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed from lncRNAs based on intersected lncRNAs. Survival times and the association between the expression levels of the key lncRNAs of the ceRNA network and the clinicopathological characteristics of HCC patients were analyzed using TCGA. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the reliability of the results in tissue samples from 20 newly-diagnosed HCC patients.<h4>Results</h4>Analysis of the literature pertaining to HCC research revealed that current research is focused on lncRNA functions in tumorigenesis and tumor development. A total of 128 HCC dysregulated lncRNAs were identified; 66 were included in the co-expressed ceRNA network. We analyzed survival times and the associations between the expression of 66 key lncRNAs and the clinicopathological features of the HCC patients identified from TCGA. Twenty-six lncRNAs were associated with clinical features of HCC (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and six key lncRNAs were associated with survival time (log-rank test <i>P</i> < 0.05). Six key lncRNAs were selected for the validation of their expression levels in 20 patients with newly diagnosed HCC using qRT-PCR. Consistent fold changes in the trends of up and down regulation between qRT-PCR validation and TCGA proved the reliability of our bioinformatics analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We used integrative bioinformatics analysis of the TCGA datasets to improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved with the functional features of lncRNAs in HCC. The results revealed that lncRNAs are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of HCC.	2020	Integrative analysis of dysregulated lncRNA-associated ceRNA network reveals potential lncRNA biomarkers for human hepatocellular carcinoma.	32201648	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC9027862	10.1186/s12967-022-03387-7	Pemphigus is an autoimmune skin disease. Ectopic lymphoid-like structures (ELSs) were found to be commonly present in the pemphigus lesions, presumably supporting in situ desmoglein (Dsg)-specific antibody production. Yet functional phenotypes and the regulators of Lymphoid aggregates in pemphigus lesions remain largely unknown. Herein, we used microarray technology to profile the gene expression in skin lesion infiltrating mononuclear cells (SIMC) from pemphigus patients. On top of that, we compared SIMC dataset to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) dataset to characterize the unique role of SIMC. Functional enrichment results showed that mononuclear cells in skin lesions and peripheral blood both had over-represented IL-17 signaling pathways while neither was characterized by an activation of type I Interferon signaling pathways. Cell-type identification with relative subsets of known RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) results showed that naïve natural killer cells (NK cells) were significantly more abundant in pemphigus lesions, and their relative abundance positively correlated with B cells abundance. Meanwhile, plasma cells population highly correlated with type 1 macrophages (M1) abundance. In addition, we also identified a lncRNA LINC01588 which might epigenetically regulate T helper 17 cells (Th17)/regulatory T cells (Treg) balance via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. Here, we provide the first transcriptomic characterization of lesion infiltrating immune cells which illustrates a distinct interplay network between adaptive and innate immune cells. It helps discover new regulators of local immune response, which potentially will provide a novel path forward to further uncover pemphigus pathological mechanisms and develop targeted therapy.	2022	Transcriptomic profiling of pemphigus lesion infiltrating mononuclear cells reveals a distinct local immune microenvironment and novel lncRNA regulators.	35449056	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8176253	10.7150/jca.58097	Recent reports show that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) FIRRE contributes to the proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and invasion of colorectal cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, the biological function of FIRRE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Here, we disclosed that the FIRRE level was frequently increased in HCC compared to nontumor tissues. Compared with normal liver cells, we also confirmed the upregulated level of FIRRE in HCC cells. Notably, the FIRRE high expression was related to malignant clinical features, including advanced TNM stage and tumor size ≥5 cm, and conferred to worse survival of HCC. Functionally, FIRRE knockdown repressed the proliferation and glycolysis of HCCLM3 cells. Overexpression of FIRRE strengthened Huh7 cell proliferation and glycolysis. Notably, FIRRE positively regulated the glycolic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4) expression in HCC cells. PFKFB4 was highly expressed and positively associated with FIRRE level in HCC tissues. The upregulated expression of PFKFB4 was associated with high tumor grade and advanced TNM stage. TCGA data revealed that the PFKFB4 high expression indicated a poor prognosis of HCC. Mechanistically, modulating FIRRE level did not affect the stability of PFKFB4 mRNA. FIRRE was mainly distributed in HCC cells' nucleus and promoted PFKFB4 transcription and expression via cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). PFKFB4 could abolish the effects of FIRRE knockdown on HCC cell proliferation and glycolysis. To conclude, the highly expressed FIRRE facilitated HCC cell proliferation and glycolysis by enhancing CREB-mediated PFKFB4 transcription and expression.	2021	Long noncoding RNA FIRRE contributes to the proliferation and glycolysis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by enhancing PFKFB4 expression.	34093813	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8582193	10.1186/s41065-021-00208-7	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide due to its high degree of malignancy, high incidence, and low survival rate. However, the underlying mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis remain unclear. Long non coding RNA (lncRNA) has been shown as a novel type of RNA. lncRNA by acting as ceRNA can participate in various biological processes of HCC cells, such as tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and drug resistance by regulating downstream target gene expression and cancer-related signaling pathways. Meanwhile, lncRNA can predict the efficacy of treatment strategies for HCC and serve as a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Therefore, lncRNA serving as ceRNA may become a vital candidate biomarker for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In this review, the epidemiology of HCC, including morbidity, mortality, regional distribution, risk factors, and current treatment advances, was briefly discussed, and some biological functions of lncRNA in HCC were summarized with emphasis on the molecular mechanism and clinical application of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA regulatory network in HCC. This paper can contribute to the better understanding of the mechanism of the influence of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA networks (ceRNETs) on HCC and provide directions and strategies for future studies.	2021	The role of ceRNA-mediated diagnosis and therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.	34758879	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

Differential gene expression analysis, univariate COX regression analysis, random forest algorithm and multiple combinatorial screening were used to construct a prognostic gene signature. Then the predictive power of the gene signature was validated in the TCGA and ICGC datasets. Furthermore, potential drugs targeting this gene signature were screened. <b>Results:</b> A total of 640 DEGs related to HCC proliferation were identified. Using univariate Cox analysis and random forest algorithm, 10 hub genes were screened. Subsequently, using multiplex combinatorial screening, five hub genes (FARSB, NOP58, CCT4, DHX37 and YARS) were identified. Taking the median risk score as a cutoff value, HCC patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis performed in the training set showed that the overall survival of the high-risk group was worse than that of the low-risk group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The ROC curve showed a good predictive efficiency of the risk score (AUC > 0.699). The risk score was related to gene mutation, cancer cell stemness and immune function changes. Prediction of immunotherapy suggetsted the IC50s of immune checkpoint inhibitors including A-443654, ABT-888, AG-014699, ATRA, AUY-922, and AZ-628 in the high-risk group were lower than those in the low-risk group, while the IC50s of AMG-706, A-770041, AICAR, AKT inhibitor VIII, Axitinib, and AZD-0530 in the high-risk group were higher than those in the low-risk group. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that FARSB was positively correlated with Hydroxyurea, Vorinostat, Nelarabine, and Lomustine, while negatively correlated with JNJ-42756493. DHX37 was positively correlated with Raltitrexed, Cytarabine, Cisplatin, Tiotepa, and Triethylene Melamine. YARS was positively correlated with Axitinib, Fluphenazine and Megestrol acetate. NOP58 was positively correlated with Vorinostat and 6-thioguanine. CCT4 was positively correlated with Nerabine. <b>Conclusion:</b> The five-gene signature associated with proliferation can be used for survival prediction and risk stratification for HCC patients.

To better explore the infection mechanism and treatment, the three-dimensional structure of human bronchus has been employed in a better in-depth study on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded a separate microarray from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO) on a human bronchial organoids sample to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGS) and analyzed it with R software. After processing with R software, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto PBMCs of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were analyzed, while a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to show the interactions and influence relationships between these differential genes. Finally, the selected highly connected genes, which are called hub genes, were verified in CytoHubba plug-in.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, a total of 966 differentially expressed genes, including 490 upregulated genes and 476 downregulated genes were used. Analysis of GO and KEGG revealed that these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to immune response and cytokines. We construct protein-protein interaction network and identify 10 hub genes, including IL6, MMP9, IL1B, CXCL8, ICAM1, FGF2, EGF, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and FN1. Finally, with the help of GSE150728, we verified that CXCl1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL5, EGF differently expressed before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, we used mRNA expression data from GSE150819 to preliminarily confirm the feasibility of hBO as an in vitro model to further study the pathogenesis and potential treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, based on the mRNA differentiated expression of this model, we found that CXCL8, CXCL10, and EGF are hub genes in the process of SARS-COV-2 infection, and we emphasized their key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection. And we also suggested that further study of these hub genes may be beneficial to treatment, prognostic prediction of COVID-19.	2021	Exploration and validation of related hub gene expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection of human bronchial organoids.	33726831	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

After encountering patients who test positive again after discharge, our study analyzed the pathogenesis to further assess the risk and possibility of virus reactivation. <h4>Methods: </h4>: A separate microarray was acquired from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO), and its samples were divided into two groups: a “convalescent-RTP” group consisting of recovery and “retesting-positive” (RTP) patients (group CR) and a “health-RTP” group consisting of healthy control and RTP patients (group HR). The enrichment analysis was performed with R software, obtaining the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto pluripotent stem cells (KEGG) of the genes and genomes. Subsequently, the protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of each group were established and the hub genes were discovered using the cytoHubba plug-in. <h4>Results: </h4>: In this study, 20 differentially expressed genes were identified, and 6622 genes were identified in the group CR, consisting of 5003 up-regulated and 1619 down-regulated genes. Meanwhile, 7335 genes were screened in the group HR, including 4323 up-regulated and 3012 down-regulated ones. The GO and KEGG analysis of the two groups revealed significant enrichment of these differentially expressed genes in pathways associated with immune response and apoptosis. In the PPI network constructed, 10 hub genes in group CR were identified, including TP53BP1, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SF3B1, SNRNP200, MRPS16, MRPS9, CALM1, PPP2R1A, YWHAZ. Similarly, TP53BP1, RPS15, EFTUD2, MRPL16, MRPL17, MRPS14, RPL35A, MRPL32, MRPS6, POLR2G were selected as hub genes. <h4>Conclusions: </h4>: Using the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression data from GSE166253, we explore the pathogenesis of retesting positive in COVID-19 from the immune mechanism and molecular level. We found TP53BP1, SNRPD1 and SNRPD2 as hub genes in RTP patients.

There have been demonstrated to exist many possible mechanisms in HCC tumorigenesis, and recent investigations have provided some promising therapy targets. However, further mechanisms remain to be researched to improve the therapeutic strategy and diagnosis of HCC. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine which plays critical roles in networks of different cellular processes, and TGF-β signaling has been found to participate in tumor initiation and development of HCC in recent years. Moreover, among the molecules and signaling pathways, researchers paid more attention to lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs), but the connection between lncRNAs and TGF-βremain poorly understood. In this review, we conclude the malignant procedure which lncRNAs and TGF-β involved in, and summarize the mechanisms of lncRNAs and TGF-βin HCC initiation and development. Furthermore, the interaction between lncRNA and TGF-β are paid more attention, and the potential therapy targets are mentioned.	2020	Modulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway by long noncoding RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma.	33292618	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8173225	10.3389/fonc.2021.651693	Cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the main first-line treatment strategies for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Unfortunately, resistance is a major obstacle in the clinical management of NPC patients. We prove that the expression level of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is dramatically increased in resistant NPC cells than that in sensitive cells. HMGB1 induces the expression and secretion of IL6, which leads to constitutive autocrine activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and eventually contributes to chemoresistance in NPC cells. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as key regulators involved in drug resistance. In this study, using GO analysis of the biological process and differential expression analysis, we find 12 significantly altered IncRNAs in NPC cell lines, which may be involved in regulating gene expression. Furthermore, we determine that elevated lncRNA MIAT level upregulates HMGB1 expression, contributing to cisplatin resistance in NPC cells. We find that the deficiency of the lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1 axis, inhibition of JAK2/STAT3, or neutralization of IL6 by antibodies significantly re-sensitizes resistant NPC cells to cisplatin in resistant NPC cells. Moreover, we provide the <i>in vivo</i> evidence that the deficiency of HMGB1 reduces cisplatin-resistant tumor growth. Most importantly, we provide clinical evidence showing that the expression level of the lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1/IL6 axis is elevated in resistant NPC tumors, which is highly correlated with poor clinical outcome. Our findings identify a novel chemoresistance mechanism regulated by the lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1/IL6 axis, which indicates the possibilities for lncRNA MIAT, HMGB1, and IL6 as biomarkers for chemoresistance and targets for developing novel strategies to overcome resistance in NPC patients.	2021	lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1 Axis Is Involved in Cisplatin Resistance <i>via</i> Regulating IL6-Mediated Activation of the JAK2/STAT3 Pathway in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.	34094941	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

Identification of ccRCC likely to progress, despite an apparent low risk at the time of surgery, represents a key clinical issue. From a cohort of adult ccRCC patients (n = 443), we selected low-risk tumors progressing within a 5-years average follow-up (progressors: P, n = 8) and non-progressing (NP) tumors (n = 16). Transcriptome sequencing, miRNA sequencing and proteomics were performed on tissues obtained at surgery. We identified 151 proteins, 1167 mRNAs and 63 miRNAs differentially expressed in P compared to NP low-risk tumors. Pathway analysis demonstrated overrepresentation of proteins related to ""LXR/RXR and FXR/RXR Activation"", ""Acute Phase Response Signaling"" in NP compared to P samples. Integrating mRNA, miRNA and proteomic data, we developed a 10-component classifier including two proteins, three genes and five miRNAs, effectively differentiating P and NP ccRCC and capturing underlying biological differences, potentially useful to identify ""low-risk"" patients requiring closer surveillance and treatment adjustments. Key results were validated by immunohistochemistry, qPCR and data from publicly available databases. Our work suggests that LXR, FXR and macrophage activation pathways could be critically involved in the inhibition of the progression of low-risk ccRCC. Furthermore, a 10-component classifier could support an early identification of apparently low-risk ccRCC patients."	2022	A multiomics disease progression signature of low-risk ccRCC.	35931808	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

Women appear more susceptible to cigarette smoke, and often develop more severe lung disease at an earlier age with less smoke exposure. We aimed to analyse whether there are sex differences in DNA methylation in lung tissue and whether these DNA methylation marks interact with smoking. We collected lung tissue samples from former smokers who underwent lung tissue resection. One hundred thirty samples from white subjects were included for this analysis. Regression models for sex as a predictor of methylation were adjusted for age, presence of COPD, smoking variables and technical batch variables revealed 710 associated sites. 294 sites demonstrated robust sex-specific methylation associations in foetal lung tissue. Pathway analysis identified 6 nominally significant pathways including the mitophagy pathway. Three CpG sites demonstrated a suggested interaction between sex and pack-years of smoking: GPR132, ANKRD44 and C19orf60. All of them were nominally significant in both male- and female-specific models, and the effect estimates were in opposite directions for male and female; GPR132 demonstrated significant association between DNA methylation and gene expression in lung tissue (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Sex-specific associations with DNA methylation in lung tissue are wide-spread and may reveal genes and pathways relevant to sex differences for lung damaging effects of cigarette smoking.	2021	Sex-specific associations with DNA methylation in lung tissue demonstrate smoking interactions.	32962511	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play crucial roles in tumor biology and immunology. However, lncRNA-immune interactions have not yet examined in prostate cancer. Here, we performed integrated analysis to characterize lncRNA-immune interactions in prostate cancer through multidimensional aspects, including immune-related hallmarks, tumor immunogenomic signatures, immune-related biological processes, immune cells, and immune checkpoints. We dissected the dysregulation of lncRNAs and their clinical relevance in prostate cancer, such as RP11-627G23.1 and RP11-465N4.5. Immune-related hallmarks took up the major parts among top significant lncRNA-hallmark interactions. Our analysis revealed that TGF-β signaling pathway was the most frequent to associate with lncRNAs, which is a signature of immune response in cancer. In addition, immune response and its regulation were the most closely connected immunological processes with lncRNA, implying the regulatory roles of lncRNAs on immune response in prostate cancer. We found that memory resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were the most lncRNA-correlated immune cell. LINC00861 was found to be potentially intervening targets of immunotherapy for prostate cancer patients, which was significantly associated with PD-1 and CTLA4. Collectively, we offered a handy resource to investigate regulatory roles of lncRNAs on tumor immunology and the development of clinical utility of lncRNAs in prostate cancer.	2021	Integrated Characterization of lncRNA-Immune Interactions in Prostate Cancer.	33665192	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

Here, through a transcriptomic analysis on whole blood collected from recipients of a two-dose schedule of TAK-003, we examine gene expression, splicing, and transcript isoform-level changes for both protein-coding and noncoding genes to broaden our understanding of the immune response. Our analysis reveals a dynamic pattern of vaccine-associated regulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), differential splicing of interferon-stimulated gene exons, and gene expression changes related to multiple signaling pathways that detect viral infection. Co-expression networks isolate immune cell-type-related and interferon-response modules that represent specific biological processes that correlate with more robust antibody responses. These data provide insights into the early determinants of the variable immune response to the vaccine, highlighting the significance of splicing and isoform-level gene regulatory mechanisms in defining vaccine immunogenicity.	2022	Transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression, splicing, and lncRNAs in response to a live attenuated dengue virus vaccine.	35139383	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

Immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) participates in tumor immune tolerance and promotes tumor progression, while the study of IDO1 in OS is limited. <b>Methods:</b> Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to test the expression of IDO1 and Ki67. The relationship between IDO1 or Ki67 positive count and clinical stage of the patient was analyzed. Laboratory test indexes including serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) at diagnosis of OS patients were collected. The relationship between positive count of IDO1 and Ki67 or laboratory test indexes was analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis. IDO1 stably overexpressed cell lines of these cells (MG63 OE, 143B OE and hFOB1.19 OE) were constructed and validated by Western blot and Elisa. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned culture media of these cells and were identified by Zetaview nanoparticle tracking analyzer. Next-generation sequencing was conducted to identify miRNAs enriched in exosomes. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were verified in clinical samples and cell lines by qPCR. Biological processes and cell components analysis of DE miRNAs was conducted by GO enrichment analysis using the protein interaction network database. <b>Results:</b> Immunosuppressive enzyme IDO1 was highly expressed in tumor tissues. 66.7% (6/9) of the tissues showed moderately or strongly positive immunostaining signal of IDO1, and 33.3% (3/9) were weakly positive. The expression of IDO1 was positively related to Ki67 and associated with prognostic-related clinical features of OS patients. Overexpression of IDO1 significantly affected the exosome-derived miRNA subsets from MG63, 143B and hFOB1.19 cells. A total of 1244 DE miRNAs were identified, and hsa-miR-23a-3p was further screened as key DE miRNA involved in the progression of OS. GO analysis of target genes of the DE miRNA results showed that target enrichment in the functions of immune regulation and tumor progression. <b>Discussion:</b> Our results indicate that IDO1 has the potential to promote the progression of OS that is related to miRNAs mediated tumor immunity. Targeting IDO1-mediated hsa-miR-23a-3p may be a potential therapeutic strategy for OS treatment.	2023	Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 promotes osteosarcoma progression by regulating tumor-derived exosomal miRNA hsa-miR-23a-3p.	37284323	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC7378647	10.7150/ijbs.45457	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths globally, is characterized by rapid growth and high invasiveness. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in the growth and metastasis of HCC. Recently, lncRNA LINC01123 has been found to contribute to cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis in lung cancer. However, the function of LINC01123 in HCC, as well as the underlying mechanism of its action, remain unclear. Here, we found that the expression of LINC01123 was clearly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to nontumor tissues. Furthermore, expression of LINC01123 in HCC cells was significantly higher than in LO2 cells. Importantly, the upregulated level of LINC01123 was related to unfavorable clinical features and poor prognosis of HCC. Next, we demonstrated that LINC01123 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells <i>in vitro</i>. Depletion of LINC01123 inhibited HCC xenograft growth <i>in vivo</i>. Conversely, ectopic expression of LINC01123 facilitated HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Mechanistically, LINC01123 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-34a-5p in HCC cells. Tuftelin1 (TUFT1) was identified as the target gene of miR-34a-5p. LINC01123 positively regulated TUFT1 level by targeting of miR-34a-5p in HCC cells. Notably, TUFT1 restoration can abolish miR-34a-5p-induced inhibitory effects on HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In conclusion, LINC01123 was overexpressed in HCC and accelerated cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the miR-34a-5p/TUFT1 axis.	2020	Long noncoding RNA LINC01123 promotes the proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by modulating the miR-34a-5p/TUFT1 axis.	32760198	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC7003030	10.3892/mmr.2020.10930	At present, the association between prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs is yet to be reported in multiple myeloma (MM). The aim of the present study was to construct prognostic models with lncRNAs and mRNAs, and to map the interactions between these lncRNAs and mRNAs in MM. LncRNA and mRNA data from 559 patients with MM were acquired from the Genome Expression Omnibus (dataset GSE24080), and their prognostic values were calculated using the survival package in R. Multivariate Cox analysis was used on the top 20 most significant prognosis‑associated mRNAs and lncRNAs to develop prognostic signatures. The performances of these prognostic signatures were tested using the survivalROC package in R, which allows for time‑dependent receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve estimation. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to investigate the associations between lncRNAs and mRNAs, and a lncRNA‑mRNA network was constructed using Cytoscape software. Univariate Cox regression analysis identified 39 lncRNAs and 1,445 mRNAs that were significantly associated with event‑free survival of MM patients. The top 20 most significant survival‑associated lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected as candidates for analyzing independent MM prognostic factors. Both signatures could be used to separate patients into two groups with distinct outcomes. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.739 for the lncRNA signature and 0.732 for the mRNA signature. In the lncRNA‑mRNA network, a total of 143 mRNAs were positively or negatively associated with 23 prognosis‑associated lncRNAs. NCRNA00201, LOC115110 and RP5‑968J1.1 were the most dominant drivers. The present study constructed a model that predicted prognosis in MM and formed a network with the corresponding prognosis‑associated mRNAs, providing a novel perspective for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of MM, and suggesting novel directions for interpreting the mechanisms underlying the development of MM.	2020	Construction of a prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNA‑mRNA network for multiple myeloma based on microarray and bioinformatics analysis.	32016443	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

Moreover, genomic alterations in PC-DLBCL have not been studied previously. We describe a case of a 57-year-old man who presented with exertional dyspnoea due to a heart mass in April 2018 and was diagnosed with PC-DLBCL characterized by immunohistochemical markers of the activated B cell (ABC) subtype and double expression of c-MYC and Bcl-2. Mutations in a total of 11 genes-TBL1XR1, CD79B, IGLL5, ZMYM3, MYD88, TMSB4X, PIM1, BTK, NRXN3, CUX1, and CSMD1-were detected via next-generation sequencing (NGS), while 19 copy number variations (CNVs) such as 1q+, 3p+, 3q+(*2), 5p+, 6p-, 6q-, 7q+, +11, 12q-, 15q-, 17q+, 17p-, +18, 19q+, 19p-, 19q-, X q+, and -Y and 4 copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) lesions located at 1q21.1q44, 3p26.3q11.2, 3q13.11q29 and 6p22.2p21.32 were identified by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping. Some key gene alterations in lymphoma, such as PRDM1 deletion and Bcl-2 amplification, were identified using SNP array analysis. The patient received 6 courses of chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, R-CHOP regimen) after surgery and is currently in remission. In summary, the present case was diagnosed as PC-DLBCL, ABC subtype by the Hans algorithm and double expression lymphoma, with co-occurrence of the MYD88L265P and CD79B mutations (MCD) subtype by genetic alteration analysis. This study presents a unique PC-DLBCL case in which complex genomic alterations were revealed by NGS and SNP array analysis, which has never been reported in the literature, and these findings could provide new insight into the genomic characterization of PC-DLBCL.	2019	Genomic Alterations In Primary Cardiac Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: A Case Report And Literature Review.	31806993	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8474442	10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100227	<h4>Background</h4>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with abnormal tau and amyloid-β accumulation in the brain, leading to neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and extracellular amyloid-β plaques. Treatment is limited to symptom management, a disease-modifying therapy is not available. To advance search of therapy approaches, there is a continued need to identify targets for disease intervention both by confirming existing hypotheses and generating new hypotheses.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a mRNA-seq study to identify genes associated with AD in post-mortem brain samples from the superior temporal gyrus (STG, n ​= ​76), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, n ​= ​65) brain regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified correcting for gender and surrogate variables to capture hidden variation not accounted for by pre-planned covariates. The results from this study were compared with the transcriptome studies from the Accelerated Medicine Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) initiative. Over-representation and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify disease-associated pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analyses were carried out and co-expressed gene modules and their hub genes were identified and associated with additional phenotypic traits of interest.<h4>Results</h4>Several hundred mRNAs were differentially expressed between AD cases and cognitively normal controls in the STG, while no and few transcripts met the same criteria (adjusted p less than 0.05 and fold change greater than 1.2) in the IFG. The findings were consistent at the gene set level with two out of three cohorts from AMP-AD. PPI analysis suggested that the DEGs were enriched in protein-protein interactions than expected by random chance. Over-representation and GSEA analysis suggested genes playing roles in neuroinflammation, amyloid-β, autophagy and trafficking being important for the AD disease process. At the gene level, 10 genes from the STG that were consistently differentially expressed in this study and in the MSBB study (one of the three cohorts within the AMP-AD initiative) were enriched in microglial genes (TREM2, C3AR1, ITGAX, OLR1, CD74, and HLA-DRA), but also included genes with a broader cell type expression pattern such as CDK2AP1. Among the DEGs with supporting evidence from an independent study, CDK2AP1 (most abundantly expressed in astrocyte) was the transcript with strongest association with antemortem cognitive measure (last Mini-Mental State Examination score) and neurofibril tangle burden but also associated with amyloid plaque burden, while OLR1 was the transcript with strongest association with amyloid plaque burden. GSEA and over-representation analyses revealed gene sets related to immune processes including neutrophil degranulation, interleukin 10 signaling, and interferon gamma signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, phagosome and neurotransmitter receptors and postsynaptic signal transmission were enriched from this study and replicated in an independent study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identified differential gene sets, common with two out of three AMP-AD cohorts (ROSMAP and MSBB) and highlights microglia and astrocyte as the key cell-types with DGEs associated with AD clinical diagnosis, and/or antemortem cognitive measure as well as neuropathological indices. Future meta-analysis and causal inferential analysis will be helpful in pinpointing the most relevant pathways and genes to intervene.	2021	Differentially expressed genes in Alzheimer's disease highlighting the roles of microglia genes including OLR1 and astrocyte gene CDK2AP1.	34589742	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

Existing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD remains incomplete.<h4>Methods</h4>Gene expression data (GSE48350) derived from post-modern brain was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were derived from hippocampus and entorhinal cortex regions between AD patients and healthy controls and detected via Morpheus. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses of DEGs, were performed via Cytoscape and followed by the construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Hub proteins were screened using the criteria: nodes degree≥10 (for hippocampus tissues) and ≥ 8 (for entorhinal cortex tissues). Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to filtrate the important clusters. University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and the database of RNA-binding protein specificities (RBPDB) were employed to identify the RNA-binding proteins of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).<h4>Results</h4>251 & 74 genes were identified as DEGs, which consisted of 56 & 16 up-regulated genes and 195 & 58 down-regulated genes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, respectively. Biological analyses demonstrated that the biological processes and pathways related to memory, transmembrane transport, synaptic transmission, neuron survival, drug metabolism, ion homeostasis and signal transduction were enriched in these genes. 11 genes were identified as hub genes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and 3 hub genes were identified as the novel candidates involved in the pathology of AD. Furthermore, 3 lncRNAs were filtrated, whose binding proteins were closely associated with AD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through GO enrichment analyses, pathway analyses and PPI analyses, we showed a comprehensive interpretation of the pathogenesis of AD at a systematic biology level, and 3 novel candidate genes and 3 lncRNAs were identified as novel and potential candidates participating in the pathology of AD. The results of this study could supply integrated insights for understanding the pathogenic mechanism underlying AD and potential novel therapeutic targets.	2019	Integrated identification of key genes and pathways in Alzheimer's disease via comprehensive bioinformatical analyses.	31346329	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

PMC7534587	10.1289/ehp6263	<h4>Background</h4>Chronic exposure to arsenic (As), a human toxicant and carcinogen, remains a global public health problem. Health risks persist after As exposure has ended, suggesting epigenetic dysregulation as a mechanistic link between exposure and health outcomes.<h4>Objectives</h4>We investigated the association between total urinary As and locus-specific DNA methylation in the Strong Heart Study, a cohort of American Indian adults with low-to-moderate As exposure [total urinary As, mean (±SD) μg/g creatinine: 11.7 (10.6)].<h4>Methods</h4>DNA methylation was measured in 2,325 participants using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. We implemented linear models to test differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and the DMRcate method to identify regions (DMRs) and conducted gene ontology enrichment analysis. Models were adjusted for estimated cell type proportions, age, sex, body mass index, smoking, education, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and study center. Arsenic was measured in urine as the sum of inorganic and methylated species.<h4>Results</h4>In adjusted models, methylation at 20 CpGs was associated with urinary As after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR< 0.05). After Bonferroni correction, 5 CpGs remained associated with total urinary As (pBonferroni<0.05), located in <i>SLC7A11</i>, <i>ANKS3</i>, <i>LINGO3</i>, <i>CSNK1D</i>, <i>ADAMTSL4</i>. We identified one DMR on chromosome 11 (chr11:2,322,050-2,323,247), annotated to <i>C11orf2</i>; <i>TSPAN32</i> genes.<h4>Discussion</h4>This is one of the first epigenome-wide association studies to investigate As exposure and locus-specific DNA methylation using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array and the largest epigenome-wide study of As exposure. The top DMP was located in <i>SLC7A11A</i>, a gene involved in cystine/glutamate transport and the biosynthesis of glutathione, an antioxidant that may protect against As-induced oxidative stress. Additional DMPs were located in genes associated with tumor development and glucose metabolism.

Based on bioinformatics generated from miRcode, starBase, and miRTarBase, we constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network) in HCC. We found 177 cancer specific lncRNAs in HCC (fold change ≥ 1.5, P < 0.01), 41 of them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade, AJCC tumor stage, and AJCC TNM staging system. Six lncRNAs (CECR7, LINC00346, MAPKAPK5-AS1, LOC338651, FLJ90757, and LOC283663) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS, log-rank P < 0.05). Collectively, our results showed the lncRNA expression patterns and a complex ceRNA network in HCC, and identified a complex cancer specific ceRNA network, which includes 14 lncRNAs and 17 miRNAs in HCC.	2015	Cancer Specific Long Noncoding RNAs Show Differential Expression Patterns and Competing Endogenous RNA Potential in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	26492393	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC6591245	10.1038/s41420-019-0190-6	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a class of epigenetic regulators implicated in a number of physiological and pathological conditions. Herein, we characterized the lncRNA expression portrait from 837 patients with invasive breast cancer and 105 normals from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), which revealed eighteen upregulated and forty-six downregulated lncRNAs. Clustering analysis revealed distinct lncRNA profile for the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and normal breast tissue, while less separation was observed among the HER2+HR+, HER2+HR-, HER2-HR+ molecular subtypes. LINC01614, and LINC01235 correlated with worse disease-free survival (DFS), while the expression of lnc-LRR1-1, lnc-ODF3B-2, AC015712.5, lnc-LAMB3-1, lnc-SPP2-3, and lnc-MAP9-2 correlated with better DFS. The expression of LINC01235 correlated with worse overall survival (OS), while the expression of MIR205HG, lnc-MAP2K6-5, FGF14-AS2, lnc-SPP2-3 correlated with better OS. Highest expression of LINC01614 was observed in progesterone receptor (PR)+, Estrogen receptor (PR)+, and HER2+ tumors, while lowest expression was in TNBC. Concordantly, LINC01614 was highly expressed in the luminalB/HER2+ subtype from the SRP062132 dataset. Elevated expression of LINC01614 was subsequently validated in primary breast cancer tissue and breast cancer cell lines. Bioinformatics and pathway analyses on LINC01614high vs. LINC01614low BC tissue revealed TGFβ1 and ECM as the most activated networks in LINC01614high tumors. Concordantly, strong correlation between the expression of LINC01614 and COL10A1 (R 2 = 0.6929), SPOCK1 (R 2 = 0.5156), ZEB1 (R 2 = 0.3372), TGFBI (R 2 = 0.2978), TGFB1 (R 2 = 0.1985), ACTA2 (R 2 = 0.1833), and TAGLN (R 2 = 0.1909) was observed. Mechanistically, exogenous TGFB1 induced LINC01614 expression in the BT474 triple positive BC model, while small-molecule inhibition of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ, SB-431542) or focal adhesion kinase (FAK, PF-573228) abrogated LINC01614 expression. Our data revealed the lncRNA transcription landscape in breast cancer and its molecular subtypes. Our data provide novel insight implicating LINC01614 as unfavorable prognostic marker in BC, its association with the HR+/HER2+ BC molecular subtype and its regulation by TGFβ and FAK signaling.	2019	Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptional landscape in breast cancer identifies LINC01614 as non-favorable prognostic biomarker regulated by TGFβ and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling.	31263577	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

As documented in cancer-related literatures, LINC00992 expression is associated with cancer progression, whereas its function in tumors including prostate cancer has not been characterized yet.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from GEPIA database suggested LINC00992 expression in prostate cancer tissues. The expression levels of RNAs were monitored via qRT-PCR. Western blot evaluated the levels of proteins. The proliferation, apoptosis and migration of prostate cancer cells were assessed by CCK-8, EdU, TUNEL, Transwell and wound healing assays. Luciferase reporter, RNA pull down and RIP assays were applied to detect the interplays among LINC00992, miR-3935 and GOLM1.<h4>Results</h4>Elevated levels of LINC00992 and GOLM1 were detected in prostate cancer tissues and cells. LINC00992 exerted facilitating functions in prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration. Mechanically, LINC00992 interacted with and negatively regulated miR-3935 to elevate GOLM1 expression in prostate cancer cells. In addition, the in vitro suppressive effect of silenced LINC00992 on prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration was reversed by GOLM1 upregulation. Likewise, LINC00992 depletion restrained tumor growth in vivo was offset by enhanced GOLM1 expression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LINC00992 competitively bound with miR-3935 to elevate GOLM1 expression and therefore facilitate the oncogenic phenotypes of prostate cancer cells, implying a potential LINC00992-targeted therapy for prostate cancer.	2020	LINC00992 contributes to the oncogenic phenotypes in prostate cancer via targeting miR-3935 and augmenting GOLM1 expression.	32781986	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC6668488	10.3389/fgene.2019.00676	Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element, which also causes neurotoxicity in exposed occupational workers. Mn causes mitochondrial toxicity; however, little is known about transcriptional responses discriminated by physiological and toxicological levels of Mn. Identification of such mechanisms could provide means to evaluate risk of Mn toxicity and also potential avenues to protect against adverse effects. To study the Mn dose-response effects on transcription, analyzed by RNA-Seq, we used human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed for 5 h to Mn (0 to 100 μM), a time point where no immediate cell death occurred at any of the doses. Results showed widespread effects on abundance of protein-coding genes for metabolism of reactive oxygen species, energy sensing, glycolysis, and protein homeostasis including the unfolded protein response and transcriptional regulation. Exposure to a concentration (10 μM Mn for 5 h) that did not result in cell death after 24-h increased abundance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the protein secretion pathway that function in protein trafficking and cellular homeostasis. These include <i>BET1</i> (Golgi vesicular membrane-trafficking protein), <i>ADAM10</i> (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10), and <i>ARFGAP3</i> (ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 3). In contrast, 5-h exposure to 100 μM Mn, a concentration that caused cell death after 24 h, increased abundance of DEGs for components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Integrated pathway analysis results showed that protein secretion gene set was associated with amino acid metabolites in response to 10 μM Mn, while oxidative phosphorylation gene set was associated with energy, lipid, and neurotransmitter metabolites at 100 μM Mn. These results show that differential effects of Mn occur at a concentration which does not cause subsequent cell death compared to a concentration that causes subsequent cell death. If these responses translate to effects on the secretory pathway and mitochondrial functions <i>in vivo</i>, differential activities of these systems could provide a sensitive basis to discriminate sub-toxic and toxic environmental and occupational Mn exposures.	2019	Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Distinct Responses to Physiologic <i>versus</i> Toxic Manganese Exposure in Human Neuroblastoma Cells.	31396262	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8311531	10.3748/wjg.v27.i26.4045	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a leading cause of cancer related mortality on a global scale. The disease itself is associated with a dismal prognosis, partly due to its silent nature resulting in patients presenting with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. To combat this, there has been an explosion in the last decade of potential candidate biomarkers in the research setting in the hope that a diagnostic biomarker may provide a glimmer of hope in what is otherwise quite a substantial clinical dilemma. Currently, serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 is utilized in the diagnostic work-up of patients diagnosed with PC however this biomarker lacks the sensitivity and specificity associated with a gold-standard marker. In the search for a biomarker that is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PC, there has been a paradigm shift towards a focus on liquid biopsy and the use of diagnostic panels which has subsequently proved to have efficacy in the diagnosis of PC. Currently, promising developments in the field of early detection on PC using diagnostic biomarkers include the detection of microRNA (miRNA) in serum and circulating tumour cells. Both these modalities, although in their infancy and yet to be widely accepted into routine clinical practice, possess merit in the early detection of PC. We reviewed over 300 biomarkers with the aim to provide an in-depth summary of the current state-of-play regarding diagnostic biomarkers in PC (serum, urinary, salivary, faecal, pancreatic juice and biliary fluid).	2021	Biomarkers in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer: Are we closer to finding the golden ticket?	34326612	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC8414682	10.1186/s12920-021-01062-2	<h4>Background</h4>Cardiovascular disease had a global prevalence of 523 million cases and 18.6 million deaths in 2019. The current standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) is coronary angiography. Surprisingly, despite well-established clinical indications, up to 40% of the one million invasive cardiac catheterizations return a result of 'no blockage'. The present studies employed RNA sequencing of whole blood to identify an RNA signature in patients with angiographically confirmed CAD.<h4>Methods</h4>Whole blood RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and analyzed by single-molecule sequencing of RNA (RNAseq) to identify transcripts associated with CAD (TRACs) in a discovery group of 96 patients presenting for elective coronary catheterization. The resulting transcript counts were compared between groups to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).<h4>Results</h4>Surprisingly, 98% of DEGs/TRACs were down-regulated ~ 1.7-fold in patients with mild to severe CAD (> 20% stenosis). The TRACs were independent of comorbid risk factors for CAD, such as sex, hypertension, and smoking. Bioinformatic analysis identified an enrichment in transcripts such as FoxP1, ICOSLG, IKZF4/Eos, SMYD3, TRIM28, and TCF3/E2A that are likely markers of regulatory T cells (Treg), consistent with known reductions in Tregs in CAD. A validation cohort of 80 patients confirmed the overall pattern (92% down-regulation) and supported many of the Treg-related changes. TRACs were enriched for transcripts associated with stress granules, which sequester RNAs, and ciliary and synaptic transcripts, possibly consistent with changes in the immune synapse of developing T cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These studies identify a novel mRNA signature of a Treg-like defect in CAD patients and provides a blueprint for a diagnostic test for CAD. The pattern of changes is consistent with stress-related changes in the maturation of T and Treg cells, possibly due to changes in the immune synapse.	2021	RNA sequencing of blood in coronary artery disease: involvement of regulatory T cell imbalance.	34479557	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC6036478	10.3892/ol.2018.8860	Colorectal cancer is a severe cancer associated with a high prevalence and fatality rate. There are three major mechanisms for colorectal cancer: (1) Chromosome instability (CIN), (2) CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and (3) mismatch repair (MMR), of which CIN is the most common type. However, these subtypes are not exclusive and overlap. To investigate their biological mechanisms and cross talk, the gene expression profiles of 585 colorectal cancer patients with CIN, CIMP and MMR status records were collected. By comparing the CIN+ and CIN-samples, CIMP+ and CIMP-samples, MMR+ and MMR-samples with minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) and incremental feature selection (IFS) methods, the CIN, CIMP and MMR associated genes were selected. Unfortunately, there was little direct overlap among them. To investigate their indirect interactions, downstream genes of CIN, CIMP and MMR were identified using the random walk with restart (RWR) method and a greater overlap of downstream genes was indicated. The common downstream genes were involved in biosynthetic and metabolic pathways. These findings were consistent with the clinical observation of wide range metabolite aberrations in colorectal cancer. To conclude, the present study gave a gene level explanation of CIN, CIMP and MMR, but also showed the network level cross talk of CIN, CIMP and MMR. The common genes of CIN, CIMP and MMR may be useful for cross-subtype general colorectal cancer drug development.	2018	Cross talk of chromosome instability, CpG island methylator phenotype and mismatch repair in colorectal cancer.	30008861	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC5667849	10.1371/journal.pone.0187457	RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays are methods for measuring gene expression across the entire transcriptome. Recent advances have made these techniques practical and affordable for essentially any laboratory with experience in molecular biology. A variety of computational methods have been developed to decrease the amount of bioinformatics expertise necessary to analyze these data. Nevertheless, many barriers persist which discourage new labs from using functional genomics approaches. Since high-quality gene expression studies have enduring value as resources to the entire research community, it is of particular importance that small labs have the capacity to share their analyzed datasets with the research community. Here we introduce ExpressionDB, an open source platform for visualizing RNA-seq and microarray data accommodating virtually any number of different samples. ExpressionDB is based on Shiny, a customizable web application which allows data sharing locally and online with customizable code written in R. ExpressionDB allows intuitive searches based on gene symbols, descriptions, or gene ontology terms, and it includes tools for dynamically filtering results based on expression level, fold change, and false-discovery rates. Built-in visualization tools include heatmaps, volcano plots, and principal component analysis, ensuring streamlined and consistent visualization to all users. All of the scripts for building an ExpressionDB with user-supplied data are freely available on GitHub, and the Creative Commons license allows fully open customization by end-users. We estimate that a demo database can be created in under one hour with minimal programming experience, and that a new database with user-supplied expression data can be completed and online in less than one day.	2017	ExpressionDB: An open source platform for distributing genome-scale datasets.	29095940	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC6730898	10.1371/journal.pone.0221476	BACKGROUND:Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) is one of the major cancers worldwide, responsible for millions of premature deaths every year. Prediction of clinical staging is vital to implement optimal therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction in cancer patients. However, to date, no method has been developed for predicting the stage of LIHC from the genomic profile of samples. METHODS:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of 173 early stage (stage-I), 177 late stage (stage-II, Stage-III and stage-IV) and 50 adjacent normal tissue samples for 60,483 RNA transcripts and 485,577 methylation CpG sites, was extensively analyzed to identify the key transcriptomic expression and methylation-based features using different feature selection techniques. Further, different classification models were developed based on selected key features to categorize different classes of samples implementing different machine learning algorithms. RESULTS:In the current study, in silico models have been developed for classifying LIHC patients in the early vs. late stage and cancerous vs. normal samples using RNA expression and DNA methylation data. TCGA datasets were extensively analyzed to identify differentially expressed RNA transcripts and methylated CpG sites that can discriminate early vs. late stages and cancer vs. normal samples of LIHC with high precision. Naive Bayes model developed using 51 features that combine 21 CpG methylation sites and 30 RNA transcripts achieved maximum MCC (Matthew's correlation coefficient) 0.58 with an accuracy of 78.87% on the validation dataset in discrimination of early and late stage. Additionally, the prediction models developed based on 5 RNA transcripts and 5 CpG sites classify LIHC and normal samples with an accuracy of 96-98% and AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) 0.99. Besides, multiclass models also developed for classifying samples in the normal, early and late stage of cancer and achieved an accuracy of 76.54% and AUC of 0.86. CONCLUSION:Our study reveals stage prediction of LIHC samples with high accuracy based on the genomics and epigenomics profiling is a challenging task in comparison to the classification of cancerous and normal samples. Comprehensive analysis, differentially expressed RNA transcripts, methylated CpG sites in LIHC samples and prediction models are available from CancerLSP (http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cancerlsp/).	2019	Classification of early and late stage liver hepatocellular carcinoma patients from their genomics and epigenomics profiles.	31490960	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC5106035	10.1371/journal.pgen.1006427	Thousands of regions in gametes have opposing methylation profiles that are largely resolved during the post-fertilization epigenetic reprogramming. However some specific sequences associated with imprinted loci survive this demethylation process. Here we present the data describing the fate of germline-derived methylation in humans. With the exception of a few known paternally methylated germline differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with known imprinted domains, we demonstrate that sperm-derived methylation is reprogrammed by the blastocyst stage of development. In contrast a large number of oocyte-derived methylation differences survive to the blastocyst stage and uniquely persist as transiently methylated DMRs only in the placenta. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is exclusive to primates, since no placenta-specific maternal methylation was observed in mouse. Utilizing single cell RNA-seq datasets from human preimplantation embryos we show that following embryonic genome activation the maternally methylated transient DMRs can orchestrate imprinted expression. However despite showing widespread imprinted expression of genes in placenta, allele-specific transcriptional profiling revealed that not all placenta-specific DMRs coordinate imprinted expression and that this maternal methylation may be absent in a minority of samples, suggestive of polymorphic imprinted methylation.	2016	Human Oocyte-Derived Methylation Differences Persist in the Placenta Revealing Widespread Transient Imprinting.	27835649	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC5355991	10.1038/srep44547	Sex differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders are well documented, with exposure to stress during gestation differentially impacting females and males. We explored sex-specific DNA methylation in the cord blood of 39 females and 32 males born at term and with appropriate weight at birth regarding their potential connection to psychiatric outcomes. Mothers were interviewed to gather information about environmental factors (gestational exposure) that could interfere with the methylation profiles in the newborns. Bisulphite converted DNA was hybridized to Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Excluding XYS probes, there were 2,332 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMSs) between sexes, which were enriched within brain modules of co-methylated CpGs during brain development and also differentially methylated in the brains of boys and girls. Genes associated with the DMSs were enriched for neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly for CpG sites found differentially methylated in brain tissue between patients with schizophrenia and controls. Moreover, the DMS had an overlap of 890 (38%) CpG sites with a cohort submitted to toxic exposition during gestation. This study supports the evidences that sex differences in DNA methylation of autosomes act as a primary driver of sex differences that are found in psychiatric outcomes.	2017	Sex differences in DNA methylation of the cord blood are related to sex-bias psychiatric diseases.	28303968	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC6328509	10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.06.08	<h4>Objective</h4>Liver metastasis, which contributes substantially to high mortality, is the most common recurrent mode of colon carcinoma. Thus, it is necessary to identify genes implicated in metastatic colonization of the liver in colon carcinoma.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared mRNA profiling in 18 normal colon mucosa (N), 20 primary tumors (T) and 19 liver metastases (M) samples from the dataset GSE49355 and GSE62321 of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene ontology (GO) and pathways of the identified genes were analyzed. Co-expression network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were employed to identify the interaction relationship. Survival analyses based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to further screening. Then, the candidate genes were validated by our data.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 22 specific genes related to liver metastasis and they were strongly associated with cell migration, adhesion, proliferation and immune response. Simultaneously, the results showed that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) might be a favorable prediction factor for survival of patients with colon carcinoma. Importantly, our validated data further suggested that lower CXCL14 represented poorer outcome and contributed to metastasis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that CXCL14 was negatively related to the regulation of stem cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).<h4>Conclusions</h4>CXCL14 was identified as a crucial anti-metastasis regulator of colon carcinoma for the first time, and might provide novel therapeutic strategies for colon carcinoma patients to improve prognosis and prevent metastasis.	2018	Identification of liver metastasis-associated genes in human colon carcinoma by mRNA profiling.	30700932	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC6781370	10.1186/s40478-019-0797-0	The majority of the clinico-pathological variability observed in patients harboring a repeat expansion in the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex subunit (C9orf72) remains unexplained. This expansion, which represents the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND), results in a loss of C9orf72 expression and the generation of RNA foci and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. The C9orf72 protein itself plays a role in vesicular transport, serving as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates GTPases. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying C9orf72-related diseases and to identify potential disease modifiers, we performed an extensive RNA sequencing study. We included individuals for whom frontal cortex tissue was available: FTLD and FTLD/MND patients with (n = 34) or without (n = 44) an expanded C9orf72 repeat as well as control subjects (n = 24). In total, 6706 genes were differentially expressed between these groups (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). The top gene was C9orf72 (FDR = 1.41E-14), which was roughly two-fold lower in C9orf72 expansion carriers than in (disease) controls. Co-expression analysis revealed groups of correlated genes (modules) that were enriched for processes such as protein folding, RNA splicing, synaptic signaling, metabolism, and Golgi vesicle transport. Within our cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, machine learning uncovered interesting candidates associated with clinico-pathological features, including age at onset (vascular endothelial growth factor A [VEGFA]), C9orf72 expansion size (cyclin dependent kinase like 1 [CDKL1]), DPR protein levels (eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase [EEF2K]), and survival after onset (small G protein signaling modulator 3 [SGSM3]). Given the fact that we detected a module involved in vesicular transport in addition to a GTPase activator (SGSM3) as a potential modifier, our findings seem to suggest that the presence of a C9orf72 repeat expansion might hamper vesicular transport and that genes affecting this process may modify the phenotype of C9orf72-linked diseases.	2019	Extensive transcriptomic study emphasizes importance of vesicular transport in C9orf72 expansion carriers.	31594549	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC9877488	10.7759/cureus.32980	<h4>Introduction</h4>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) due to its ability to spread inflammatory proteins throughout the nervous system. We hypothesized that filtration of the CSF could remove pathogenic proteins and prevent them from altering motor phenotypes in a mouse model.<h4>Methods</h4>We filtered the CSF from 11 ALS patients via 100 kilodaltons (kD) molecular weight cut-off filters. We used mass spectrometry-based discovery proteomics workflows to compare protein abundances before and after filtration. To test the effects of CSF filtration on motor function, we injected groups of mice with saline, filtered ALS-CSF, or unfiltered ALS-CSF (n=12 per group) and assessed motor function via pole descent and open field tests.<h4>Results</h4>We identified proteins implicated in ALS pathogenesis and showed that these were removed in significant amounts in our workflow. Key filtered proteins included complement proteins, chitinases, serine protease inhibitors, and neuro-inflammatory proteins such as amyloid precursor protein, chromogranin A, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Compared to the filtered ALS-CSF mice, unfiltered ALS-CSF mice took longer to descend a pole (10 days post-injection, 11.14 seconds vs 14.25 seconds, p = 0.02) and explored less on an open field (one day post-injection, 21.81 m vs 16.83 m, p = 0.0004).<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated the ability to filter proteins from the CSF of ALS patients and identified potentially pathologic proteins that were reduced in quantity. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability of unfiltered ALS-CSF to induce motor deficits in mice on the pole descent and open field tests and showed that filtration could prevent this deficit. Given the lack of effective treatments for ALS, this could be a novel solution for patients suffering from this deadly and irreversible condition.	2022	Filtered Cerebrospinal Fluid From Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Displays an Altered Proteome and Affects Motor Phenotype in a Mouse Model.	36712738	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol
PMC5311031	10.1038/onc.2016.279	Recurrent mutations in core splicing factors have been reported in several clonal disorders, including cancers. Mutations in SF3B1, a component of the U2 splicing complex, are the most common. SF3B1 mutations are associated with aberrant pre-mRNA splicing using cryptic 3' splice sites (3'SSs), but the mechanism of their selection is not clear. To understand how cryptic 3'SSs are selected, we performed comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide changes to splicing and gene expression associated with SF3B1 mutations in patient samples as well as an experimental model of inducible expression. Hundreds of cryptic 3'SS were detectable across the genome in cells expressing mutant SF3B1. These 3'SS are typically sequestered within RNA secondary structures and poorly accessible compared with their corresponding canonical 3'SS. We hypothesized that these cryptic 3'SS are inaccessible during normal splicing catalysis and that this constraint is overcome in spliceosomes containing mutant SF3B1. This model of secondary structure-dependent selection of cryptic 3'SS was found across multiple clonal processes associated with SF3B1 mutations (myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia). We validated our model predictions in mini-gene splicing assays. Additionally, we found deregulated expression of proteins with relevant functions in splicing factor-related diseases both in association with aberrant splicing and without corresponding splicing changes. Our results show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with a distinct splicing program shared across multiple clonal processes and define a biochemical mechanism for altered 3'SS choice.	2017	Cancer-associated SF3B1 mutants recognize otherwise inaccessible cryptic 3' splice sites within RNA secondary structures.	27524419	A1BG-AS1	A1BGAS	primary_symbol

NA	10.1007/s13577-021-00554-8	The dysregulated long non-coding RNA A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) has been implicated in the oncogenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction in this study, we detected A1BG-AS1 expression in breast cancer and elucidated the regulatory functions and exact mechanisms of A1BG-AS1 in breast cancer cells. The regulatory functions of A1BG-AS1 were examined in vitro using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometric, and Transwell migration and invasion assays and in vivo through tumor xenograft experiments. In addition, we performed bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments to verify the interaction among A1BG-AS1, microRNA-485-5p (miR-485-5p), and flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in breast cancer. We found A1BG-AS1 to be highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. In terms of function, depleted A1BG-AS1 markedly suppressed cell proliferation, accelerated cell apoptosis, and hindered cell migration and invasion in breast cancer. Furthermore, A1BG-AS1 interference reduced tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations confirmed that A1BG-AS1 directly interacted with miR-485-5p as a molecular sponge. We demonstrated that FLOT1 is a direct target of miR-485-5p, which could be positively regulated by A1BG-AS1 by competing for miR-485-5p. Rescue experiments clearly showed that the downregulation of miR-485-5p and upregulation of FLOT1 were capable of reversing the anticancer activities of A1BG-AS1 deficiency in terms of breast cancer cell malignancy. A1BG-AS1 acts as a miR-485-5p sponge and subsequently increases FLOT1 expression in breast cancer cells, ultimately facilitating cancer progression. Hence, the A1BG-AS1/miR-485-5p/FLOT1 pathway might offer a novel therapeutic perspective for breast cancer.	2021	Long non-coding RNA A1BG-AS1 promotes tumorigenesis in breast cancer by sponging microRNA-485-5p and consequently increasing expression of FLOT1 expression.	34115333	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
NA	10.1002/jcb.28315	Extensive evidence indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulates the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the expression and biological function of lncRNA A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) were poorly known in HCC. Here, we found the underexpression of A1BG-AS1 in HCC via analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Further analyses confirmed that A1BG-AS1 expression in HCC was markedly lower than that in noncancerous tissues based on our HCC cohort. Clinical association analysis revealed that low A1BG-AS1 expression correlated with poor prognostic features, such as microvascular invasion, high tumor grade, and advanced tumor stage. Follow-up data indicated that low A1BG-AS1 level evidently correlated with poor clinical outcomes of HCC patients. Moreover, forced expression of A1BG-AS1 repressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Conversely, A1BG-AS1 knockdown promoted these malignant behaviors in HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, A1BG-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA by directly sponging miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Notably, miR-216a-5p restoration rescued A1BG-AS1 attenuated proliferation, migration and invasion of HCCLM3 cells. A1BG-AS1 positively regulated the levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog and SMAD family member 7, which were reduced by miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Altogether, we conclude that A1BG-AS1 exerts a tumor suppressive role in HCC progression.	2019	lncRNA A1BG-AS1 suppresses proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting miR-216a-5p.	30556161	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

Cord blood DNA methylation was measured by Illumina HumanMethylation 450K in one subset (N = 189) and EPICarray in another (N = 349). High (vegetation height>3 m (m)), low (vegetation height<3 m) and total (including both) high-resolution green space exposures during pregnancy were estimated within 100 m and 1000 m distance around maternal residence. In each subset, we sought cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites via linear mixed models adjusted on newborns' sex, ethnicity, gestational age, season at delivery, sampling day, maternal parity, age, smoking, education, and estimated blood cell proportions. EWASs results were meta-analysed via fixed-effects meta-analyses. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified via ENmix-combp and DMRcate algorithms. Sensitivity analyses were additionally adjusted on PM<sub>2.5</sub>, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income. In the 450K subset, cord blood expression of differentially methylated genes was measured by Agilent microarrays and associated with green space.<h4>Results</h4>147 DMRs were identified, 85 of which were still significant upon adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income, including HLA-DRB5, RPTOR, KCNQ1DN, A1BG-AS1, HTR2A, ZNF274, COL11A1 and PRSS36 DMRs. One CpG reached genome-wide significance, while 54 CpGs were suggestive significant (p-values<1e-05). Among them, a CpG, hypermethylated with 100 m buffer total green space, was annotated to PAQR9, whose expression decreased with 1000 m buffer low green space (p-value = 1.45e-05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results demonstrate that maternal exposure to green space during pregnancy is associated with cord blood DNA methylation, mainly at loci organized in regions, in genes playing important roles in neurological development (e.g., HTR2A).	2023	Epigenome-wide analysis of maternal exposure to green space during gestation and cord blood DNA methylation in the ENVIRONAGE cohort.	36400229	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

However, the relationship and interaction mechanism between lncRNAs and fatty acid signaling in HCC remain unclear. Data regarding RNA expression and clinical outcomes for patients with HCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), HCCDB, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Hallmark pathways were identified using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method. ConsensusClusterPlus was used to establish a consistency matrix for classifying samples into three subtypes. A risk signature was established, and predictive values for key lncRNAs related to prognosis were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. The ESTIMATE algorithm, MCP-Counter, and ssGSEA were used to evaluate the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment. The CTRP2.0 and PRISM were used to analyze drug sensitivity in HCC subtypes. We discovered seven fatty-acid-associated lncRNAs with predictive prognostic capabilities, including TRAF3IP2-AS1, SNHG10, AL157392.2, LINC02641, AL357079.1, AC046134.2, and A1BG-AS. Three subtypes were obtained, which presented with differences in prognosis, clinical information, mutation features, pathway traits, immune characteristics, and drug sensitivity. The seven key lncRNAs identified in this study might serve as promising biomarkers for predicting prognosis in patients with HCC, and the three HCC subtypes classified according to lncRNA expression profiles could improve HCC classification.	2022	A novel classification of HCC basing on fatty-acid-associated lncRNA.	36344648	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

However, the function of lncRNAs remains poorly understood, especially in the context of infection with low-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs). To further understanding on this issue, we investigated lncRNA expression in HPV-induced common warts.<h4>Methods</h4>A publicly available high-throughput sequencing dataset for common warts was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). lncRNA profiles were generated using the NetworkAnalyst 3.0 workflow, and a list of differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs in common warts was identified and inputted into the ENCODE, RegNetwork, DisGeNet, and miRNet platforms.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 54 lncRNAs were revealed to be significantly dysregulated in common warts. Of these 54 lncRNAs, 24 and 30 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The most significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs in common warts included the <i>CERNA2</i>, <i>LINC02159</i>, <i>SH3PXD2A-AS1</i>, and <i>UNC5B-AS1</i> genes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current findings suggest that HPV-induced warts impact the host lncRNA transcriptome. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the impact of low-risk HPV infection on lncRNA expression profiles.	2022	Network analysis of long non-coding RNA expression profiles in common warts.	36458289	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

Our aim was to develop a metabolism-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signature to assess the prognosis of BC patients in order to optimize treatment. Metabolism-related genes between breast tumors and normal tissues were screened out, and Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate metabolism-related lncRNAs. In total, five metabolism-related lncRNAs were enrolled to establish prognostic signatures. Kaplan-Meier plots and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated good performance in both training and validation groups. Further analysis demonstrated that the signature was an independent prognostic factor for BC. A nomogram incorporating risk score and tumor stage was then constructed to evaluate the 3 - and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with BC. In conclusion, this study identified a metabolism-related lncRNA signature that can predict RFS of BC patients and established a prognostic nomogram that helps guide the individualized treatment of patients at different risks.	2021	Metabolism-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential biomarkers for predicting risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients.	34254565	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

We aimed to identify autophagy-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to elucidate the molecular mechanism of UM. Here, we show that LINC01278 is a new potential biomarker with clinical prognostic value in UM through bioinformatics analysis. Application of an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) and an autophagy agonist (MG-132) indicated that LINC01278 can inhibit UM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inducing autophagy. A xenograft nude mouse model was used to examine the tumorigenesis of UM cells in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC01278 can inhibit the mTOR signalling pathway to activate autophagy, as shown by experiments with an mTOR agonist (MHY1485) and mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) treatment. Our findings indicate that LINC01278 functions as a tumour suppressor by inhibiting the mTOR signalling pathway to induce autophagy. Targeting the LINC01278-mTOR axis might be a novel and promising therapeutic approach for UM.	2023	LINC01278 Induces Autophagy to Inhibit Tumour Progression by Suppressing the mTOR Signalling Pathway.	36713034	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC8517989	10.7150/jca.63351	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical drivers and suppressors of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The downregulation of transmembrane protein 220 antisense RNA 1 (TMEM220-AS1) is correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. Nevertheless, the role of TMEM220-AS1 in HCC and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, TMEM220-AS1 levels were markedly reduced in HCC tissues compared with noncancerous tissues. TMEM220-AS1 downregulation was confirmed in HCC cell lines. TMEM220-AS1 expression was associated with tumor stage, venous infiltration, tumor size, and survival of HCC patients. TMEM220-AS1 overexpression suppressed the migration, invasion, and proliferation of HCC cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of TMEM220-AS1 increased TMEM220 levels in HCC cells. Decreased TMEM220 levels were observed in HCC tissues and cell lines. TMEM220 expression was positively correlated with TMEM220-AS1 levels in HCC tissue samples and TMEM220 downregulation was significantly correlated with reduced patient survival. TMEM220 overexpression suppressed HCC cell proliferation and mobility. TMEM220 knockdown eliminated the suppressive effect of TMEM220-AS1 in HCCLM3 cells. Mechanistically, TMEM220 overexpression reduced the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and decreased MYC, Cyclin D1, and Snail1 mRNA levels in HCCLM3 cells. BIO, a GSK3β inhibitor, eliminated TMEM220-induced Wnt/β-catenin pathway inactivation and inhibited HCC cell proliferation and mobility. In conclusion, TMEM220-AS1 and TMEM220 were expressed at low levels in HCC patients. TMEM220-AS1 inhibited the malignant behavior of HCC cells by enhancing TMEM220 expression and subsequently inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.	2021	LncRNA TMEM220-AS1 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the TMEM220/β-catenin axis.	34659569	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

The immune microenvironment alteration played a crucial role in this process. The study aimed to identify immune-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in HBV-related HCC and explore potential mechanisms.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 1,072 immune-related genes (IRGs) were enriched in different co-expression modules with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) combining the corresponding clinical features in HBV-related HCC. The immune-related lncRNAs were selected from the crucial co-expression model based on the correlation analysis with IRGs. The immune-related lncRNAs were furtherly used to construct prognostic signature by the Cox proportional hazards regression and Lasso regression. Furthermore, the proliferation and migration ability of lncRNA SNHG10 were verified in vitro.<h4>Results</h4>A total of nine co-expression modules were identified by WGCNA of which the ""red"" co-expression module was most correlated with various clinical characteristics. Additionally, the IRGs in this module were significantly enriched in multiple immune-related pathways.

Abnormal expression of GLUT1 is associated with a variety of cancers. However, the biological role of GLUT1 in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) remains to be determined.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed the expression of GLUT1 in pan-cancer and ESCA as well as clinicopathological analysis through multiple databases. Use R and STRING to perform GO/KEGG function enrichment and PPI analysis for GLUT1 co-expression. TIMER and CIBERSORT were used to analyze the relationship between GLUT1 expression and immune infiltration in ESCA. The TCGA ESCA cohort was used to analyze the relationship between GLUT1 expression and m6A modification in ESCA, and to construct a regulatory network in line with the ceRNA hypothesis.<h4>Results</h4>GLUT1 is highly expressed in a variety of tumors including ESCA, and is closely related to histological types and histological grade. GO/KEGG functional enrichment analysis revealed that GLUT1 is closely related to structural constituent of cytoskeleton, intermediate filament binding, cell-cell adheres junction, epidermis development, and P53 signaling pathway. PPI shows that GLUT1 is closely related to TP53, GIPC1 and INS, and these three proteins all play an important role in tumor proliferation. CIBERSORT analysis showed that GLUT1 expression is related to the infiltration of multiple immune cells. When GLUT1 is highly expressed, the number of memory B cells decreases. ESCA cohort analysis found that GLUT1 expression was related to 7 m6A modifier genes. Six possible crRNA networks in ESCA were constructed by correlation analysis, and all these ceRNA networks contained GLUT1.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GLUT1 can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of ESCA, and is related to tumor immune infiltration, m6A modification and ceRNA network.	2021	Comprehensive Analysis of GLUT1 Immune Infiltrates and ceRNA Network in Human Esophageal Carcinoma.	34123828	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC8669964	10.3389/fcell.2021.781285	There are many types of cancers. Although they share some hallmarks, such as proliferation and metastasis, they are still very different from many perspectives. They grow on different organ or tissues. Does each cancer have a unique gene expression pattern that makes it different from other cancer types? After the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, there are more and more pan-cancer studies. Researchers want to get robust gene expression signature from pan-cancer patients. But there is large variance in cancer patients due to heterogeneity. To get robust results, the sample size will be too large to recruit. In this study, we tried another approach to get robust pan-cancer biomarkers by using the cell line data to reduce the variance. We applied several advanced computational methods to analyze the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) gene expression profiles which included 988 cell lines from 20 cancer types. Two feature selection methods, including Boruta, and max-relevance and min-redundancy methods, were applied to the cell line gene expression data one by one, generating a feature list. Such list was fed into incremental feature selection method, incorporating one classification algorithm, to extract biomarkers, construct optimal classifiers and decision rules. The optimal classifiers provided good performance, which can be useful tools to identify cell lines from different cancer types, whereas the biomarkers (e.g. NCKAP1, TNFRSF12A, LAMB2, FKBP9, PFN2, TOM1L1) and rules identified in this work may provide a meaningful and precise reference for differentiating multiple types of cancer and contribute to the personalized treatment of tumors.	2021	Identification of Pan-Cancer Biomarkers Based on the Gene Expression Profiles of Cancer Cell Lines.	34917619	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

Thus, we aimed to establish an IRL-based tool to improve prognosis prediction in BC patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We obtained IRL expression profiles in large BC cohorts (N = 911) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, in light of the correlation between each IRL and recurrence-free survival (RFS), we screened prognostic IRL signatures to construct a novel RFS nomogram via a Cox regression model. Subsequently, the performance of the IRL-based model was evaluated through discrimination, calibration ability, risk stratification ability and decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 52 IRLs were obtained from TCGA. Based on multivariate Cox regression analyses, four IRLs (A1BG-AS1, AC004477.3, AC004585.1 and AC004854.2) and two risk parameters (tumor subtype and TNM stage) were utilized as independent indicators to develop a novel prognostic model. In terms of predictive accuracy, the IRL-based model was distinctly superior to the TNM staging system (AUC: 0.728 VS 0.673, P = 0.010). DCA indicated that our nomogram had favorable clinical practicability. In addition, risk stratification analysis showed that the IRL-based tool efficiently divided BC patients into high- and low-risk groups (P < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel IRL-based model was constructed to predict the risk of 5-year RFS in BC. Our model can improve the predictive power of the TNM staging system and identify high-risk patients with tumor recurrence to implement more appropriate treatment strategies.	2020	Molecular characterization of breast cancer: a potential novel immune-related lncRNAs signature.	33160384	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute an emerging class of transcripts with a potential for high tissue specificity and function. Therefore, we tested the biomarker potential of lncRNAs on Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), a complex type of adult multipotent stem cells of diverse tissue origins, that is frequently used in clinics but which is lacking extensive characterization.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a dedicated bioinformatics pipeline for the purpose of building a cell-specific catalogue of unannotated lncRNAs. The pipeline performs ab initio transcript identification, pseudoalignment and uses new methodologies such as a specific k-mer approach for naive quantification of expression in numerous RNAseq data. We next applied it on MSCs, and our pipeline was able to highlight novel lncRNAs with high cell specificity. Furthermore, with original and efficient approaches for functional prediction, we demonstrated that each candidate represents one specific state of MSCs biology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We showed that our approach can be employed to harness lncRNAs as cell markers.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the reliability of the results in tissue samples from 20 newly-diagnosed HCC patients.<h4>Results</h4>Analysis of the literature pertaining to HCC research revealed that current research is focused on lncRNA functions in tumorigenesis and tumor development. A total of 128 HCC dysregulated lncRNAs were identified; 66 were included in the co-expressed ceRNA network. We analyzed survival times and the associations between the expression of 66 key lncRNAs and the clinicopathological features of the HCC patients identified from TCGA. Twenty-six lncRNAs were associated with clinical features of HCC (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and six key lncRNAs were associated with survival time (log-rank test <i>P</i> < 0.05). Six key lncRNAs were selected for the validation of their expression levels in 20 patients with newly diagnosed HCC using qRT-PCR. Consistent fold changes in the trends of up and down regulation between qRT-PCR validation and TCGA proved the reliability of our bioinformatics analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We used integrative bioinformatics analysis of the TCGA datasets to improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved with the functional features of lncRNAs in HCC. The results revealed that lncRNAs are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of HCC.	2020	Integrative analysis of dysregulated lncRNA-associated ceRNA network reveals potential lncRNA biomarkers for human hepatocellular carcinoma.	32201648	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC9027862	10.1186/s12967-022-03387-7	Pemphigus is an autoimmune skin disease. Ectopic lymphoid-like structures (ELSs) were found to be commonly present in the pemphigus lesions, presumably supporting in situ desmoglein (Dsg)-specific antibody production. Yet functional phenotypes and the regulators of Lymphoid aggregates in pemphigus lesions remain largely unknown. Herein, we used microarray technology to profile the gene expression in skin lesion infiltrating mononuclear cells (SIMC) from pemphigus patients. On top of that, we compared SIMC dataset to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) dataset to characterize the unique role of SIMC. Functional enrichment results showed that mononuclear cells in skin lesions and peripheral blood both had over-represented IL-17 signaling pathways while neither was characterized by an activation of type I Interferon signaling pathways. Cell-type identification with relative subsets of known RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) results showed that naïve natural killer cells (NK cells) were significantly more abundant in pemphigus lesions, and their relative abundance positively correlated with B cells abundance. Meanwhile, plasma cells population highly correlated with type 1 macrophages (M1) abundance. In addition, we also identified a lncRNA LINC01588 which might epigenetically regulate T helper 17 cells (Th17)/regulatory T cells (Treg) balance via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. Here, we provide the first transcriptomic characterization of lesion infiltrating immune cells which illustrates a distinct interplay network between adaptive and innate immune cells. It helps discover new regulators of local immune response, which potentially will provide a novel path forward to further uncover pemphigus pathological mechanisms and develop targeted therapy.	2022	Transcriptomic profiling of pemphigus lesion infiltrating mononuclear cells reveals a distinct local immune microenvironment and novel lncRNA regulators.	35449056	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC8176253	10.7150/jca.58097	Recent reports show that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) FIRRE contributes to the proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and invasion of colorectal cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, the biological function of FIRRE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Here, we disclosed that the FIRRE level was frequently increased in HCC compared to nontumor tissues. Compared with normal liver cells, we also confirmed the upregulated level of FIRRE in HCC cells. Notably, the FIRRE high expression was related to malignant clinical features, including advanced TNM stage and tumor size ≥5 cm, and conferred to worse survival of HCC. Functionally, FIRRE knockdown repressed the proliferation and glycolysis of HCCLM3 cells. Overexpression of FIRRE strengthened Huh7 cell proliferation and glycolysis. Notably, FIRRE positively regulated the glycolic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4) expression in HCC cells. PFKFB4 was highly expressed and positively associated with FIRRE level in HCC tissues. The upregulated expression of PFKFB4 was associated with high tumor grade and advanced TNM stage. TCGA data revealed that the PFKFB4 high expression indicated a poor prognosis of HCC. Mechanistically, modulating FIRRE level did not affect the stability of PFKFB4 mRNA. FIRRE was mainly distributed in HCC cells' nucleus and promoted PFKFB4 transcription and expression via cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). PFKFB4 could abolish the effects of FIRRE knockdown on HCC cell proliferation and glycolysis. To conclude, the highly expressed FIRRE facilitated HCC cell proliferation and glycolysis by enhancing CREB-mediated PFKFB4 transcription and expression.	2021	Long noncoding RNA FIRRE contributes to the proliferation and glycolysis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by enhancing PFKFB4 expression.	34093813	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC8582193	10.1186/s41065-021-00208-7	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide due to its high degree of malignancy, high incidence, and low survival rate. However, the underlying mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis remain unclear. Long non coding RNA (lncRNA) has been shown as a novel type of RNA. lncRNA by acting as ceRNA can participate in various biological processes of HCC cells, such as tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and drug resistance by regulating downstream target gene expression and cancer-related signaling pathways. Meanwhile, lncRNA can predict the efficacy of treatment strategies for HCC and serve as a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Therefore, lncRNA serving as ceRNA may become a vital candidate biomarker for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In this review, the epidemiology of HCC, including morbidity, mortality, regional distribution, risk factors, and current treatment advances, was briefly discussed, and some biological functions of lncRNA in HCC were summarized with emphasis on the molecular mechanism and clinical application of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA regulatory network in HCC. This paper can contribute to the better understanding of the mechanism of the influence of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA networks (ceRNETs) on HCC and provide directions and strategies for future studies.	2021	The role of ceRNA-mediated diagnosis and therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.	34758879	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC9273781	10.3389/fgene.2022.900380	<b>Background:</b> This study aimed to screen potential drugs targeting a new prognostic gene signature associated with proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). <b>Methods:</b> CRISPR Library and TCGA datasets were used to explore differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the proliferation of HCC cells. Differential gene expression analysis, univariate COX regression analysis, random forest algorithm and multiple combinatorial screening were used to construct a prognostic gene signature. Then the predictive power of the gene signature was validated in the TCGA and ICGC datasets. Furthermore, potential drugs targeting this gene signature were screened. <b>Results:</b> A total of 640 DEGs related to HCC proliferation were identified. Using univariate Cox analysis and random forest algorithm, 10 hub genes were screened. Subsequently, using multiplex combinatorial screening, five hub genes (FARSB, NOP58, CCT4, DHX37 and YARS) were identified. Taking the median risk score as a cutoff value, HCC patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis performed in the training set showed that the overall survival of the high-risk group was worse than that of the low-risk group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The ROC curve showed a good predictive efficiency of the risk score (AUC > 0.699). The risk score was related to gene mutation, cancer cell stemness and immune function changes. Prediction of immunotherapy suggetsted the IC50s of immune checkpoint inhibitors including A-443654, ABT-888, AG-014699, ATRA, AUY-922, and AZ-628 in the high-risk group were lower than those in the low-risk group, while the IC50s of AMG-706, A-770041, AICAR, AKT inhibitor VIII, Axitinib, and AZD-0530 in the high-risk group were higher than those in the low-risk group. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that FARSB was positively correlated with Hydroxyurea, Vorinostat, Nelarabine, and Lomustine, while negatively correlated with JNJ-42756493. DHX37 was positively correlated with Raltitrexed, Cytarabine, Cisplatin, Tiotepa, and Triethylene Melamine. YARS was positively correlated with Axitinib, Fluphenazine and Megestrol acetate. NOP58 was positively correlated with Vorinostat and 6-thioguanine. CCT4 was positively correlated with Nerabine. <b>Conclusion:</b> The five-gene signature associated with proliferation can be used for survival prediction and risk stratification for HCC patients. Potential drugs targeting this gene signature deserve further attention in the treatment of HCC.	2022	Machine Learning Screens Potential Drugs Targeting a Prognostic Gene Signature Associated With Proliferation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	35836576	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC7962432	10.1186/s40246-021-00316-5	<h4>Background</h4>In the novel coronavirus pandemic, the high infection rate and high mortality have seriously affected people's health and social order. To better explore the infection mechanism and treatment, the three-dimensional structure of human bronchus has been employed in a better in-depth study on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded a separate microarray from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO) on a human bronchial organoids sample to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGS) and analyzed it with R software. After processing with R software, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto PBMCs of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were analyzed, while a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to show the interactions and influence relationships between these differential genes. Finally, the selected highly connected genes, which are called hub genes, were verified in CytoHubba plug-in.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, a total of 966 differentially expressed genes, including 490 upregulated genes and 476 downregulated genes were used. Analysis of GO and KEGG revealed that these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to immune response and cytokines. We construct protein-protein interaction network and identify 10 hub genes, including IL6, MMP9, IL1B, CXCL8, ICAM1, FGF2, EGF, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and FN1. Finally, with the help of GSE150728, we verified that CXCl1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL5, EGF differently expressed before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, we used mRNA expression data from GSE150819 to preliminarily confirm the feasibility of hBO as an in vitro model to further study the pathogenesis and potential treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, based on the mRNA differentiated expression of this model, we found that CXCL8, CXCL10, and EGF are hub genes in the process of SARS-COV-2 infection, and we emphasized their key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection. And we also suggested that further study of these hub genes may be beneficial to treatment, prognostic prediction of COVID-19.	2021	Exploration and validation of related hub gene expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection of human bronchial organoids.	33726831	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

After encountering patients who test positive again after discharge, our study analyzed the pathogenesis to further assess the risk and possibility of virus reactivation. <h4>Methods: </h4>: A separate microarray was acquired from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO), and its samples were divided into two groups: a “convalescent-RTP” group consisting of recovery and “retesting-positive” (RTP) patients (group CR) and a “health-RTP” group consisting of healthy control and RTP patients (group HR). The enrichment analysis was performed with R software, obtaining the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto pluripotent stem cells (KEGG) of the genes and genomes. Subsequently, the protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of each group were established and the hub genes were discovered using the cytoHubba plug-in. <h4>Results: </h4>: In this study, 20 differentially expressed genes were identified, and 6622 genes were identified in the group CR, consisting of 5003 up-regulated and 1619 down-regulated genes. Meanwhile, 7335 genes were screened in the group HR, including 4323 up-regulated and 3012 down-regulated ones. The GO and KEGG analysis of the two groups revealed significant enrichment of these differentially expressed genes in pathways associated with immune response and apoptosis. In the PPI network constructed, 10 hub genes in group CR were identified, including TP53BP1, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SF3B1, SNRNP200, MRPS16, MRPS9, CALM1, PPP2R1A, YWHAZ. Similarly, TP53BP1, RPS15, EFTUD2, MRPL16, MRPL17, MRPS14, RPL35A, MRPL32, MRPS6, POLR2G were selected as hub genes. <h4>Conclusions: </h4>: Using the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression data from GSE166253, we explore the pathogenesis of retesting positive in COVID-19 from the immune mechanism and molecular level. We found TP53BP1, SNRPD1 and SNRPD2 as hub genes in RTP patients. Hence, their regulatory pathway is vital to the management and prognostic prediction of RTP patients, rendering the further study of these hub genes necessary.	2021	Screening the Hub Genes and Analyzing the Mechanisms in Discharged COVID-19 Patients Retesting Positive through Bioinformatics Analysis	NA	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC7709261	10.1186/s40364-020-00252-x	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of liver cancer with poor prognosis. There have been demonstrated to exist many possible mechanisms in HCC tumorigenesis, and recent investigations have provided some promising therapy targets. However, further mechanisms remain to be researched to improve the therapeutic strategy and diagnosis of HCC. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine which plays critical roles in networks of different cellular processes, and TGF-β signaling has been found to participate in tumor initiation and development of HCC in recent years. Moreover, among the molecules and signaling pathways, researchers paid more attention to lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs), but the connection between lncRNAs and TGF-βremain poorly understood. In this review, we conclude the malignant procedure which lncRNAs and TGF-β involved in, and summarize the mechanisms of lncRNAs and TGF-βin HCC initiation and development. Furthermore, the interaction between lncRNA and TGF-β are paid more attention, and the potential therapy targets are mentioned.	2020	Modulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway by long noncoding RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma.	33292618	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC8173225	10.3389/fonc.2021.651693	Cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the main first-line treatment strategies for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Unfortunately, resistance is a major obstacle in the clinical management of NPC patients. We prove that the expression level of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is dramatically increased in resistant NPC cells than that in sensitive cells. HMGB1 induces the expression and secretion of IL6, which leads to constitutive autocrine activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and eventually contributes to chemoresistance in NPC cells. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as key regulators involved in drug resistance. In this study, using GO analysis of the biological process and differential expression analysis, we find 12 significantly altered IncRNAs in NPC cell lines, which may be involved in regulating gene expression. Furthermore, we determine that elevated lncRNA MIAT level upregulates HMGB1 expression, contributing to cisplatin resistance in NPC cells. We find that the deficiency of the lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1 axis, inhibition of JAK2/STAT3, or neutralization of IL6 by antibodies significantly re-sensitizes resistant NPC cells to cisplatin in resistant NPC cells. Moreover, we provide the <i>in vivo</i> evidence that the deficiency of HMGB1 reduces cisplatin-resistant tumor growth. Most importantly, we provide clinical evidence showing that the expression level of the lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1/IL6 axis is elevated in resistant NPC tumors, which is highly correlated with poor clinical outcome. Our findings identify a novel chemoresistance mechanism regulated by the lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1/IL6 axis, which indicates the possibilities for lncRNA MIAT, HMGB1, and IL6 as biomarkers for chemoresistance and targets for developing novel strategies to overcome resistance in NPC patients.	2021	lncRNA MIAT/HMGB1 Axis Is Involved in Cisplatin Resistance <i>via</i> Regulating IL6-Mediated Activation of the JAK2/STAT3 Pathway in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.	34094941	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

Identification of ccRCC likely to progress, despite an apparent low risk at the time of surgery, represents a key clinical issue. From a cohort of adult ccRCC patients (n = 443), we selected low-risk tumors progressing within a 5-years average follow-up (progressors: P, n = 8) and non-progressing (NP) tumors (n = 16). Transcriptome sequencing, miRNA sequencing and proteomics were performed on tissues obtained at surgery. We identified 151 proteins, 1167 mRNAs and 63 miRNAs differentially expressed in P compared to NP low-risk tumors. Pathway analysis demonstrated overrepresentation of proteins related to ""LXR/RXR and FXR/RXR Activation"", ""Acute Phase Response Signaling"" in NP compared to P samples. Integrating mRNA, miRNA and proteomic data, we developed a 10-component classifier including two proteins, three genes and five miRNAs, effectively differentiating P and NP ccRCC and capturing underlying biological differences, potentially useful to identify ""low-risk"" patients requiring closer surveillance and treatment adjustments. Key results were validated by immunohistochemistry, qPCR and data from publicly available databases. Our work suggests that LXR, FXR and macrophage activation pathways could be critically involved in the inhibition of the progression of low-risk ccRCC.

Women appear more susceptible to cigarette smoke, and often develop more severe lung disease at an earlier age with less smoke exposure. We aimed to analyse whether there are sex differences in DNA methylation in lung tissue and whether these DNA methylation marks interact with smoking. We collected lung tissue samples from former smokers who underwent lung tissue resection. One hundred thirty samples from white subjects were included for this analysis. Regression models for sex as a predictor of methylation were adjusted for age, presence of COPD, smoking variables and technical batch variables revealed 710 associated sites. 294 sites demonstrated robust sex-specific methylation associations in foetal lung tissue. Pathway analysis identified 6 nominally significant pathways including the mitophagy pathway. Three CpG sites demonstrated a suggested interaction between sex and pack-years of smoking: GPR132, ANKRD44 and C19orf60. All of them were nominally significant in both male- and female-specific models, and the effect estimates were in opposite directions for male and female; GPR132 demonstrated significant association between DNA methylation and gene expression in lung tissue (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Sex-specific associations with DNA methylation in lung tissue are wide-spread and may reveal genes and pathways relevant to sex differences for lung damaging effects of cigarette smoking.	2021	Sex-specific associations with DNA methylation in lung tissue demonstrate smoking interactions.	32962511	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play crucial roles in tumor biology and immunology. However, lncRNA-immune interactions have not yet examined in prostate cancer. Here, we performed integrated analysis to characterize lncRNA-immune interactions in prostate cancer through multidimensional aspects, including immune-related hallmarks, tumor immunogenomic signatures, immune-related biological processes, immune cells, and immune checkpoints. We dissected the dysregulation of lncRNAs and their clinical relevance in prostate cancer, such as RP11-627G23.1 and RP11-465N4.5. Immune-related hallmarks took up the major parts among top significant lncRNA-hallmark interactions. Our analysis revealed that TGF-β signaling pathway was the most frequent to associate with lncRNAs, which is a signature of immune response in cancer. In addition, immune response and its regulation were the most closely connected immunological processes with lncRNA, implying the regulatory roles of lncRNAs on immune response in prostate cancer. We found that memory resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were the most lncRNA-correlated immune cell. LINC00861 was found to be potentially intervening targets of immunotherapy for prostate cancer patients, which was significantly associated with PD-1 and CTLA4. Collectively, we offered a handy resource to investigate regulatory roles of lncRNAs on tumor immunology and the development of clinical utility of lncRNAs in prostate cancer.	2021	Integrated Characterization of lncRNA-Immune Interactions in Prostate Cancer.	33665192	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

Immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) participates in tumor immune tolerance and promotes tumor progression, while the study of IDO1 in OS is limited. <b>Methods:</b> Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to test the expression of IDO1 and Ki67. The relationship between IDO1 or Ki67 positive count and clinical stage of the patient was analyzed. Laboratory test indexes including serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) at diagnosis of OS patients were collected. The relationship between positive count of IDO1 and Ki67 or laboratory test indexes was analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis. IDO1 stably overexpressed cell lines of these cells (MG63 OE, 143B OE and hFOB1.19 OE) were constructed and validated by Western blot and Elisa. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned culture media of these cells and were identified by Zetaview nanoparticle tracking analyzer. Next-generation sequencing was conducted to identify miRNAs enriched in exosomes. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were verified in clinical samples and cell lines by qPCR. Biological processes and cell components analysis of DE miRNAs was conducted by GO enrichment analysis using the protein interaction network database. <b>Results:</b> Immunosuppressive enzyme IDO1 was highly expressed in tumor tissues. 66.7% (6/9) of the tissues showed moderately or strongly positive immunostaining signal of IDO1, and 33.3% (3/9) were weakly positive. The expression of IDO1 was positively related to Ki67 and associated with prognostic-related clinical features of OS patients. Overexpression of IDO1 significantly affected the exosome-derived miRNA subsets from MG63, 143B and hFOB1.19 cells. A total of 1244 DE miRNAs were identified, and hsa-miR-23a-3p was further screened as key DE miRNA involved in the progression of OS. GO analysis of target genes of the DE miRNA results showed that target enrichment in the functions of immune regulation and tumor progression. <b>Discussion:</b> Our results indicate that IDO1 has the potential to promote the progression of OS that is related to miRNAs mediated tumor immunity.

PMC7378647	10.7150/ijbs.45457	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths globally, is characterized by rapid growth and high invasiveness. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in the growth and metastasis of HCC. Recently, lncRNA LINC01123 has been found to contribute to cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis in lung cancer. However, the function of LINC01123 in HCC, as well as the underlying mechanism of its action, remain unclear. Here, we found that the expression of LINC01123 was clearly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to nontumor tissues. Furthermore, expression of LINC01123 in HCC cells was significantly higher than in LO2 cells. Importantly, the upregulated level of LINC01123 was related to unfavorable clinical features and poor prognosis of HCC. Next, we demonstrated that LINC01123 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells <i>in vitro</i>. Depletion of LINC01123 inhibited HCC xenograft growth <i>in vivo</i>. Conversely, ectopic expression of LINC01123 facilitated HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Mechanistically, LINC01123 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-34a-5p in HCC cells. Tuftelin1 (TUFT1) was identified as the target gene of miR-34a-5p. LINC01123 positively regulated TUFT1 level by targeting of miR-34a-5p in HCC cells. Notably, TUFT1 restoration can abolish miR-34a-5p-induced inhibitory effects on HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In conclusion, LINC01123 was overexpressed in HCC and accelerated cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the miR-34a-5p/TUFT1 axis.	2020	Long noncoding RNA LINC01123 promotes the proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by modulating the miR-34a-5p/TUFT1 axis.	32760198	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC7003030	10.3892/mmr.2020.10930	At present, the association between prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs is yet to be reported in multiple myeloma (MM). The aim of the present study was to construct prognostic models with lncRNAs and mRNAs, and to map the interactions between these lncRNAs and mRNAs in MM. LncRNA and mRNA data from 559 patients with MM were acquired from the Genome Expression Omnibus (dataset GSE24080), and their prognostic values were calculated using the survival package in R. Multivariate Cox analysis was used on the top 20 most significant prognosis‑associated mRNAs and lncRNAs to develop prognostic signatures. The performances of these prognostic signatures were tested using the survivalROC package in R, which allows for time‑dependent receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve estimation. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to investigate the associations between lncRNAs and mRNAs, and a lncRNA‑mRNA network was constructed using Cytoscape software. Univariate Cox regression analysis identified 39 lncRNAs and 1,445 mRNAs that were significantly associated with event‑free survival of MM patients. The top 20 most significant survival‑associated lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected as candidates for analyzing independent MM prognostic factors. Both signatures could be used to separate patients into two groups with distinct outcomes. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.739 for the lncRNA signature and 0.732 for the mRNA signature. In the lncRNA‑mRNA network, a total of 143 mRNAs were positively or negatively associated with 23 prognosis‑associated lncRNAs. NCRNA00201, LOC115110 and RP5‑968J1.1 were the most dominant drivers. The present study constructed a model that predicted prognosis in MM and formed a network with the corresponding prognosis‑associated mRNAs, providing a novel perspective for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of MM, and suggesting novel directions for interpreting the mechanisms underlying the development of MM.	2020	Construction of a prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNA‑mRNA network for multiple myeloma based on microarray and bioinformatics analysis.	32016443	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

Mutations in a total of 11 genes-TBL1XR1, CD79B, IGLL5, ZMYM3, MYD88, TMSB4X, PIM1, BTK, NRXN3, CUX1, and CSMD1-were detected via next-generation sequencing (NGS), while 19 copy number variations (CNVs) such as 1q+, 3p+, 3q+(*2), 5p+, 6p-, 6q-, 7q+, +11, 12q-, 15q-, 17q+, 17p-, +18, 19q+, 19p-, 19q-, X q+, and -Y and 4 copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) lesions located at 1q21.1q44, 3p26.3q11.2, 3q13.11q29 and 6p22.2p21.32 were identified by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping. Some key gene alterations in lymphoma, such as PRDM1 deletion and Bcl-2 amplification, were identified using SNP array analysis. The patient received 6 courses of chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, R-CHOP regimen) after surgery and is currently in remission. In summary, the present case was diagnosed as PC-DLBCL, ABC subtype by the Hans algorithm and double expression lymphoma, with co-occurrence of the MYD88L265P and CD79B mutations (MCD) subtype by genetic alteration analysis. This study presents a unique PC-DLBCL case in which complex genomic alterations were revealed by NGS and SNP array analysis, which has never been reported in the literature, and these findings could provide new insight into the genomic characterization of PC-DLBCL.	2019	Genomic Alterations In Primary Cardiac Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: A Case Report And Literature Review.	31806993	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC8474442	10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100227	<h4>Background</h4>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with abnormal tau and amyloid-β accumulation in the brain, leading to neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and extracellular amyloid-β plaques. Treatment is limited to symptom management, a disease-modifying therapy is not available. To advance search of therapy approaches, there is a continued need to identify targets for disease intervention both by confirming existing hypotheses and generating new hypotheses.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a mRNA-seq study to identify genes associated with AD in post-mortem brain samples from the superior temporal gyrus (STG, n ​= ​76), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, n ​= ​65) brain regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified correcting for gender and surrogate variables to capture hidden variation not accounted for by pre-planned covariates. The results from this study were compared with the transcriptome studies from the Accelerated Medicine Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) initiative. Over-representation and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify disease-associated pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analyses were carried out and co-expressed gene modules and their hub genes were identified and associated with additional phenotypic traits of interest.<h4>Results</h4>Several hundred mRNAs were differentially expressed between AD cases and cognitively normal controls in the STG, while no and few transcripts met the same criteria (adjusted p less than 0.05 and fold change greater than 1.2) in the IFG. The findings were consistent at the gene set level with two out of three cohorts from AMP-AD. PPI analysis suggested that the DEGs were enriched in protein-protein interactions than expected by random chance. Over-representation and GSEA analysis suggested genes playing roles in neuroinflammation, amyloid-β, autophagy and trafficking being important for the AD disease process. At the gene level, 10 genes from the STG that were consistently differentially expressed in this study and in the MSBB study (one of the three cohorts within the AMP-AD initiative) were enriched in microglial genes (TREM2, C3AR1, ITGAX, OLR1, CD74, and HLA-DRA), but also included genes with a broader cell type expression pattern such as CDK2AP1. Among the DEGs with supporting evidence from an independent study, CDK2AP1 (most abundantly expressed in astrocyte) was the transcript with strongest association with antemortem cognitive measure (last Mini-Mental State Examination score) and neurofibril tangle burden but also associated with amyloid plaque burden, while OLR1 was the transcript with strongest association with amyloid plaque burden. GSEA and over-representation analyses revealed gene sets related to immune processes including neutrophil degranulation, interleukin 10 signaling, and interferon gamma signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, phagosome and neurotransmitter receptors and postsynaptic signal transmission were enriched from this study and replicated in an independent study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identified differential gene sets, common with two out of three AMP-AD cohorts (ROSMAP and MSBB) and highlights microglia and astrocyte as the key cell-types with DGEs associated with AD clinical diagnosis, and/or antemortem cognitive measure as well as neuropathological indices. Future meta-analysis and causal inferential analysis will be helpful in pinpointing the most relevant pathways and genes to intervene.	2021	Differentially expressed genes in Alzheimer's disease highlighting the roles of microglia genes including OLR1 and astrocyte gene CDK2AP1.	34589742	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC7415429	10.7150/ijbs.46822	MiR-216a-5p has opposite effects on tumorigenesis and progression in the context of different tumors, acting as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene. However, the expression and function of miR-216a-5p in pancreatic cancer (PC) is not well characterized. In this study, we found miR-216a-5p was significantly downregulated in PC tissues and cell lines, which showed a negative correlation with peripancreatic lymph, perineural invasion and TNM stage of PCs patients. We made use of functional assays to reveal that miR-216a-5p inhibited growth and migration of PC cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Then, by employing the bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated TPT1 was a potential target of miR-216a-5p, which contributes to tumor malignance by mediating mTORC1 pathway-associated autophagy. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis and RNA pulldown confirmed that miR-216a-5p was mediated by LINC01133, which sponge miR-216a-5p, as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Collectively, our study revealed an important role of LINC01133/miR-216a-5p/TPT1 axis in the genesis and progression of PCs, which provides potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and therapy of PCs.	2020	MiR-216a-5p inhibits tumorigenesis in Pancreatic Cancer by targeting TPT1/mTORC1 and is mediated by LINC01133.	32792860	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC6636172	10.1186/s41065-019-0101-0	<h4>Background</h4>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be caused by multiple factors, meanwhile the pathogenic mechanism and development of AD associate closely with genetic factors. Existing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD remains incomplete.<h4>Methods</h4>Gene expression data (GSE48350) derived from post-modern brain was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were derived from hippocampus and entorhinal cortex regions between AD patients and healthy controls and detected via Morpheus. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses of DEGs, were performed via Cytoscape and followed by the construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Hub proteins were screened using the criteria: nodes degree≥10 (for hippocampus tissues) and ≥ 8 (for entorhinal cortex tissues). Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to filtrate the important clusters. University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and the database of RNA-binding protein specificities (RBPDB) were employed to identify the RNA-binding proteins of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).<h4>Results</h4>251 & 74 genes were identified as DEGs, which consisted of 56 & 16 up-regulated genes and 195 & 58 down-regulated genes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, respectively. Biological analyses demonstrated that the biological processes and pathways related to memory, transmembrane transport, synaptic transmission, neuron survival, drug metabolism, ion homeostasis and signal transduction were enriched in these genes. 11 genes were identified as hub genes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and 3 hub genes were identified as the novel candidates involved in the pathology of AD. Furthermore, 3 lncRNAs were filtrated, whose binding proteins were closely associated with AD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through GO enrichment analyses, pathway analyses and PPI analyses, we showed a comprehensive interpretation of the pathogenesis of AD at a systematic biology level, and 3 novel candidate genes and 3 lncRNAs were identified as novel and potential candidates participating in the pathology of AD. The results of this study could supply integrated insights for understanding the pathogenic mechanism underlying AD and potential novel therapeutic targets.	2019	Integrated identification of key genes and pathways in Alzheimer's disease via comprehensive bioinformatical analyses.	31346329	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

The lncRNA LINC00339 was reported to regulate the development of lung cancer or breast cancer. However, whether LINC00339 participates in HCC progression remains unclear. Here, our results showed that LINC00339 was upregulated in HCC. <b>Methods:</b> qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) was used to analyze LINC00339 expression in tumor tissues and cell lines. CCK8 and colony formation assays were used to analyze cell proliferation. Transwell assay was used to analyze cell migration and invasion. Xenograft experiment was used to test tumor growth in vivo. <b>Results:</b> LINC00339 overexpression was correlated with an advanced stage, metastasis, and bad prognosis in HCC patients. Functional investigation showed that LINC00339 knockdown significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, decreased LINC00339 expression inhibited HCC growth in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00339 could interact with miR-1182 to promote SKA1 expression. We also demonstrated that SKA1 acted as an oncogene and SKA1 upregulation reversed the effect of LINC00339 silencing. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results illustrated that the LINC00339/miR-1182/SKA1 axis plays an essential role in HCC progression.	2019	LINC00339 promotes growth and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma by the miR-1182/SKA1 pathway.	31239716	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC7534587	10.1289/ehp6263	<h4>Background</h4>Chronic exposure to arsenic (As), a human toxicant and carcinogen, remains a global public health problem. Health risks persist after As exposure has ended, suggesting epigenetic dysregulation as a mechanistic link between exposure and health outcomes.<h4>Objectives</h4>We investigated the association between total urinary As and locus-specific DNA methylation in the Strong Heart Study, a cohort of American Indian adults with low-to-moderate As exposure [total urinary As, mean (±SD) μg/g creatinine: 11.7 (10.6)].<h4>Methods</h4>DNA methylation was measured in 2,325 participants using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. We implemented linear models to test differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and the DMRcate method to identify regions (DMRs) and conducted gene ontology enrichment analysis. Models were adjusted for estimated cell type proportions, age, sex, body mass index, smoking, education, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and study center. Arsenic was measured in urine as the sum of inorganic and methylated species.<h4>Results</h4>In adjusted models, methylation at 20 CpGs was associated with urinary As after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR< 0.05). After Bonferroni correction, 5 CpGs remained associated with total urinary As (pBonferroni<0.05), located in <i>SLC7A11</i>, <i>ANKS3</i>, <i>LINGO3</i>, <i>CSNK1D</i>, <i>ADAMTSL4</i>. We identified one DMR on chromosome 11 (chr11:2,322,050-2,323,247), annotated to <i>C11orf2</i>; <i>TSPAN32</i> genes.<h4>Discussion</h4>This is one of the first epigenome-wide association studies to investigate As exposure and locus-specific DNA methylation using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array and the largest epigenome-wide study of As exposure. The top DMP was located in <i>SLC7A11A</i>, a gene involved in cystine/glutamate transport and the biosynthesis of glutathione, an antioxidant that may protect against As-induced oxidative stress. Additional DMPs were located in genes associated with tumor development and glucose metabolism. Further research is needed, including research in more diverse populations, to investigate whether As-related DNA methylation signatures are associated with gene expression or may serve as biomarkers of disease development. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6263.	2020	Locus-Specific Differential DNA Methylation and Urinary Arsenic: An Epigenome-Wide Association Study in Blood among Adults with Low-to-Moderate Arsenic Exposure.	32603190	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

However, the roles of cancer specific lncRNA and its related competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network in hepatocellular cell carcinoma (HCC) are not fully understood. The lncRNA profiles in 372 HCC patients, including 372 tumor and 48 adjacent non-tumor liver tissues, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCBI GEO omnibus (GSE65485) were analyzed. Cancer specific lncRNAs (or HCC related lncRNAs) were identified and correlated with clinical features. Based on bioinformatics generated from miRcode, starBase, and miRTarBase, we constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network) in HCC. We found 177 cancer specific lncRNAs in HCC (fold change ≥ 1.5, P < 0.01), 41 of them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade, AJCC tumor stage, and AJCC TNM staging system. Six lncRNAs (CECR7, LINC00346, MAPKAPK5-AS1, LOC338651, FLJ90757, and LOC283663) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS, log-rank P < 0.05). Collectively, our results showed the lncRNA expression patterns and a complex ceRNA network in HCC, and identified a complex cancer specific ceRNA network, which includes 14 lncRNAs and 17 miRNAs in HCC.	2015	Cancer Specific Long Noncoding RNAs Show Differential Expression Patterns and Competing Endogenous RNA Potential in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	26492393	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC6591245	10.1038/s41420-019-0190-6	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a class of epigenetic regulators implicated in a number of physiological and pathological conditions. Herein, we characterized the lncRNA expression portrait from 837 patients with invasive breast cancer and 105 normals from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), which revealed eighteen upregulated and forty-six downregulated lncRNAs. Clustering analysis revealed distinct lncRNA profile for the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and normal breast tissue, while less separation was observed among the HER2+HR+, HER2+HR-, HER2-HR+ molecular subtypes. LINC01614, and LINC01235 correlated with worse disease-free survival (DFS), while the expression of lnc-LRR1-1, lnc-ODF3B-2, AC015712.5, lnc-LAMB3-1, lnc-SPP2-3, and lnc-MAP9-2 correlated with better DFS. The expression of LINC01235 correlated with worse overall survival (OS), while the expression of MIR205HG, lnc-MAP2K6-5, FGF14-AS2, lnc-SPP2-3 correlated with better OS. Highest expression of LINC01614 was observed in progesterone receptor (PR)+, Estrogen receptor (PR)+, and HER2+ tumors, while lowest expression was in TNBC. Concordantly, LINC01614 was highly expressed in the luminalB/HER2+ subtype from the SRP062132 dataset. Elevated expression of LINC01614 was subsequently validated in primary breast cancer tissue and breast cancer cell lines. Bioinformatics and pathway analyses on LINC01614high vs. LINC01614low BC tissue revealed TGFβ1 and ECM as the most activated networks in LINC01614high tumors. Concordantly, strong correlation between the expression of LINC01614 and COL10A1 (R 2 = 0.6929), SPOCK1 (R 2 = 0.5156), ZEB1 (R 2 = 0.3372), TGFBI (R 2 = 0.2978), TGFB1 (R 2 = 0.1985), ACTA2 (R 2 = 0.1833), and TAGLN (R 2 = 0.1909) was observed. Mechanistically, exogenous TGFB1 induced LINC01614 expression in the BT474 triple positive BC model, while small-molecule inhibition of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ, SB-431542) or focal adhesion kinase (FAK, PF-573228) abrogated LINC01614 expression. Our data revealed the lncRNA transcription landscape in breast cancer and its molecular subtypes. Our data provide novel insight implicating LINC01614 as unfavorable prognostic marker in BC, its association with the HR+/HER2+ BC molecular subtype and its regulation by TGFβ and FAK signaling.	2019	Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptional landscape in breast cancer identifies LINC01614 as non-favorable prognostic biomarker regulated by TGFβ and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling.	31263577	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

As documented in cancer-related literatures, LINC00992 expression is associated with cancer progression, whereas its function in tumors including prostate cancer has not been characterized yet.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from GEPIA database suggested LINC00992 expression in prostate cancer tissues. The expression levels of RNAs were monitored via qRT-PCR. Western blot evaluated the levels of proteins. The proliferation, apoptosis and migration of prostate cancer cells were assessed by CCK-8, EdU, TUNEL, Transwell and wound healing assays. Luciferase reporter, RNA pull down and RIP assays were applied to detect the interplays among LINC00992, miR-3935 and GOLM1.<h4>Results</h4>Elevated levels of LINC00992 and GOLM1 were detected in prostate cancer tissues and cells. LINC00992 exerted facilitating functions in prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration. Mechanically, LINC00992 interacted with and negatively regulated miR-3935 to elevate GOLM1 expression in prostate cancer cells. In addition, the in vitro suppressive effect of silenced LINC00992 on prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration was reversed by GOLM1 upregulation. Likewise, LINC00992 depletion restrained tumor growth in vivo was offset by enhanced GOLM1 expression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LINC00992 competitively bound with miR-3935 to elevate GOLM1 expression and therefore facilitate the oncogenic phenotypes of prostate cancer cells, implying a potential LINC00992-targeted therapy for prostate cancer.	2020	LINC00992 contributes to the oncogenic phenotypes in prostate cancer via targeting miR-3935 and augmenting GOLM1 expression.	32781986	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC6668488	10.3389/fgene.2019.00676	Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element, which also causes neurotoxicity in exposed occupational workers. Mn causes mitochondrial toxicity; however, little is known about transcriptional responses discriminated by physiological and toxicological levels of Mn. Identification of such mechanisms could provide means to evaluate risk of Mn toxicity and also potential avenues to protect against adverse effects. To study the Mn dose-response effects on transcription, analyzed by RNA-Seq, we used human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed for 5 h to Mn (0 to 100 μM), a time point where no immediate cell death occurred at any of the doses. Results showed widespread effects on abundance of protein-coding genes for metabolism of reactive oxygen species, energy sensing, glycolysis, and protein homeostasis including the unfolded protein response and transcriptional regulation. Exposure to a concentration (10 μM Mn for 5 h) that did not result in cell death after 24-h increased abundance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the protein secretion pathway that function in protein trafficking and cellular homeostasis. These include <i>BET1</i> (Golgi vesicular membrane-trafficking protein), <i>ADAM10</i> (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10), and <i>ARFGAP3</i> (ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 3). In contrast, 5-h exposure to 100 μM Mn, a concentration that caused cell death after 24 h, increased abundance of DEGs for components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Integrated pathway analysis results showed that protein secretion gene set was associated with amino acid metabolites in response to 10 μM Mn, while oxidative phosphorylation gene set was associated with energy, lipid, and neurotransmitter metabolites at 100 μM Mn. These results show that differential effects of Mn occur at a concentration which does not cause subsequent cell death compared to a concentration that causes subsequent cell death. If these responses translate to effects on the secretory pathway and mitochondrial functions <i>in vivo</i>, differential activities of these systems could provide a sensitive basis to discriminate sub-toxic and toxic environmental and occupational Mn exposures.	2019	Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Distinct Responses to Physiologic <i>versus</i> Toxic Manganese Exposure in Human Neuroblastoma Cells.	31396262	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC8311531	10.3748/wjg.v27.i26.4045	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a leading cause of cancer related mortality on a global scale. The disease itself is associated with a dismal prognosis, partly due to its silent nature resulting in patients presenting with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. To combat this, there has been an explosion in the last decade of potential candidate biomarkers in the research setting in the hope that a diagnostic biomarker may provide a glimmer of hope in what is otherwise quite a substantial clinical dilemma. Currently, serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 is utilized in the diagnostic work-up of patients diagnosed with PC however this biomarker lacks the sensitivity and specificity associated with a gold-standard marker. In the search for a biomarker that is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PC, there has been a paradigm shift towards a focus on liquid biopsy and the use of diagnostic panels which has subsequently proved to have efficacy in the diagnosis of PC. Currently, promising developments in the field of early detection on PC using diagnostic biomarkers include the detection of microRNA (miRNA) in serum and circulating tumour cells. Both these modalities, although in their infancy and yet to be widely accepted into routine clinical practice, possess merit in the early detection of PC. We reviewed over 300 biomarkers with the aim to provide an in-depth summary of the current state-of-play regarding diagnostic biomarkers in PC (serum, urinary, salivary, faecal, pancreatic juice and biliary fluid).	2021	Biomarkers in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer: Are we closer to finding the golden ticket?	34326612	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

The current standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) is coronary angiography. Surprisingly, despite well-established clinical indications, up to 40% of the one million invasive cardiac catheterizations return a result of 'no blockage'. The present studies employed RNA sequencing of whole blood to identify an RNA signature in patients with angiographically confirmed CAD.<h4>Methods</h4>Whole blood RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and analyzed by single-molecule sequencing of RNA (RNAseq) to identify transcripts associated with CAD (TRACs) in a discovery group of 96 patients presenting for elective coronary catheterization. The resulting transcript counts were compared between groups to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).<h4>Results</h4>Surprisingly, 98% of DEGs/TRACs were down-regulated ~ 1.7-fold in patients with mild to severe CAD (> 20% stenosis). The TRACs were independent of comorbid risk factors for CAD, such as sex, hypertension, and smoking. Bioinformatic analysis identified an enrichment in transcripts such as FoxP1, ICOSLG, IKZF4/Eos, SMYD3, TRIM28, and TCF3/E2A that are likely markers of regulatory T cells (Treg), consistent with known reductions in Tregs in CAD. A validation cohort of 80 patients confirmed the overall pattern (92% down-regulation) and supported many of the Treg-related changes. TRACs were enriched for transcripts associated with stress granules, which sequester RNAs, and ciliary and synaptic transcripts, possibly consistent with changes in the immune synapse of developing T cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These studies identify a novel mRNA signature of a Treg-like defect in CAD patients and provides a blueprint for a diagnostic test for CAD. The pattern of changes is consistent with stress-related changes in the maturation of T and Treg cells, possibly due to changes in the immune synapse.	2021	RNA sequencing of blood in coronary artery disease: involvement of regulatory T cell imbalance.	34479557	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC6036478	10.3892/ol.2018.8860	Colorectal cancer is a severe cancer associated with a high prevalence and fatality rate. There are three major mechanisms for colorectal cancer: (1) Chromosome instability (CIN), (2) CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and (3) mismatch repair (MMR), of which CIN is the most common type. However, these subtypes are not exclusive and overlap. To investigate their biological mechanisms and cross talk, the gene expression profiles of 585 colorectal cancer patients with CIN, CIMP and MMR status records were collected. By comparing the CIN+ and CIN-samples, CIMP+ and CIMP-samples, MMR+ and MMR-samples with minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) and incremental feature selection (IFS) methods, the CIN, CIMP and MMR associated genes were selected. Unfortunately, there was little direct overlap among them. To investigate their indirect interactions, downstream genes of CIN, CIMP and MMR were identified using the random walk with restart (RWR) method and a greater overlap of downstream genes was indicated. The common downstream genes were involved in biosynthetic and metabolic pathways. These findings were consistent with the clinical observation of wide range metabolite aberrations in colorectal cancer. To conclude, the present study gave a gene level explanation of CIN, CIMP and MMR, but also showed the network level cross talk of CIN, CIMP and MMR. The common genes of CIN, CIMP and MMR may be useful for cross-subtype general colorectal cancer drug development.	2018	Cross talk of chromosome instability, CpG island methylator phenotype and mismatch repair in colorectal cancer.	30008861	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC5667849	10.1371/journal.pone.0187457	RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays are methods for measuring gene expression across the entire transcriptome. Recent advances have made these techniques practical and affordable for essentially any laboratory with experience in molecular biology. A variety of computational methods have been developed to decrease the amount of bioinformatics expertise necessary to analyze these data. Nevertheless, many barriers persist which discourage new labs from using functional genomics approaches. Since high-quality gene expression studies have enduring value as resources to the entire research community, it is of particular importance that small labs have the capacity to share their analyzed datasets with the research community. Here we introduce ExpressionDB, an open source platform for visualizing RNA-seq and microarray data accommodating virtually any number of different samples. ExpressionDB is based on Shiny, a customizable web application which allows data sharing locally and online with customizable code written in R. ExpressionDB allows intuitive searches based on gene symbols, descriptions, or gene ontology terms, and it includes tools for dynamically filtering results based on expression level, fold change, and false-discovery rates. Built-in visualization tools include heatmaps, volcano plots, and principal component analysis, ensuring streamlined and consistent visualization to all users. All of the scripts for building an ExpressionDB with user-supplied data are freely available on GitHub, and the Creative Commons license allows fully open customization by end-users. We estimate that a demo database can be created in under one hour with minimal programming experience, and that a new database with user-supplied expression data can be completed and online in less than one day.	2017	ExpressionDB: An open source platform for distributing genome-scale datasets.	29095940	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC6730898	10.1371/journal.pone.0221476	BACKGROUND:Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) is one of the major cancers worldwide, responsible for millions of premature deaths every year. Prediction of clinical staging is vital to implement optimal therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction in cancer patients. However, to date, no method has been developed for predicting the stage of LIHC from the genomic profile of samples. METHODS:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of 173 early stage (stage-I), 177 late stage (stage-II, Stage-III and stage-IV) and 50 adjacent normal tissue samples for 60,483 RNA transcripts and 485,577 methylation CpG sites, was extensively analyzed to identify the key transcriptomic expression and methylation-based features using different feature selection techniques. Further, different classification models were developed based on selected key features to categorize different classes of samples implementing different machine learning algorithms. RESULTS:In the current study, in silico models have been developed for classifying LIHC patients in the early vs. late stage and cancerous vs. normal samples using RNA expression and DNA methylation data. TCGA datasets were extensively analyzed to identify differentially expressed RNA transcripts and methylated CpG sites that can discriminate early vs. late stages and cancer vs. normal samples of LIHC with high precision. Naive Bayes model developed using 51 features that combine 21 CpG methylation sites and 30 RNA transcripts achieved maximum MCC (Matthew's correlation coefficient) 0.58 with an accuracy of 78.87% on the validation dataset in discrimination of early and late stage. Additionally, the prediction models developed based on 5 RNA transcripts and 5 CpG sites classify LIHC and normal samples with an accuracy of 96-98% and AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) 0.99. Besides, multiclass models also developed for classifying samples in the normal, early and late stage of cancer and achieved an accuracy of 76.54% and AUC of 0.86. CONCLUSION:Our study reveals stage prediction of LIHC samples with high accuracy based on the genomics and epigenomics profiling is a challenging task in comparison to the classification of cancerous and normal samples.

However some specific sequences associated with imprinted loci survive this demethylation process. Here we present the data describing the fate of germline-derived methylation in humans. With the exception of a few known paternally methylated germline differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with known imprinted domains, we demonstrate that sperm-derived methylation is reprogrammed by the blastocyst stage of development. In contrast a large number of oocyte-derived methylation differences survive to the blastocyst stage and uniquely persist as transiently methylated DMRs only in the placenta. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is exclusive to primates, since no placenta-specific maternal methylation was observed in mouse. Utilizing single cell RNA-seq datasets from human preimplantation embryos we show that following embryonic genome activation the maternally methylated transient DMRs can orchestrate imprinted expression. However despite showing widespread imprinted expression of genes in placenta, allele-specific transcriptional profiling revealed that not all placenta-specific DMRs coordinate imprinted expression and that this maternal methylation may be absent in a minority of samples, suggestive of polymorphic imprinted methylation.	2016	Human Oocyte-Derived Methylation Differences Persist in the Placenta Revealing Widespread Transient Imprinting.	27835649	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC5355991	10.1038/srep44547	Sex differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders are well documented, with exposure to stress during gestation differentially impacting females and males. We explored sex-specific DNA methylation in the cord blood of 39 females and 32 males born at term and with appropriate weight at birth regarding their potential connection to psychiatric outcomes. Mothers were interviewed to gather information about environmental factors (gestational exposure) that could interfere with the methylation profiles in the newborns. Bisulphite converted DNA was hybridized to Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Excluding XYS probes, there were 2,332 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMSs) between sexes, which were enriched within brain modules of co-methylated CpGs during brain development and also differentially methylated in the brains of boys and girls. Genes associated with the DMSs were enriched for neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly for CpG sites found differentially methylated in brain tissue between patients with schizophrenia and controls. Moreover, the DMS had an overlap of 890 (38%) CpG sites with a cohort submitted to toxic exposition during gestation. This study supports the evidences that sex differences in DNA methylation of autosomes act as a primary driver of sex differences that are found in psychiatric outcomes.	2017	Sex differences in DNA methylation of the cord blood are related to sex-bias psychiatric diseases.	28303968	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC6328509	10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.06.08	<h4>Objective</h4>Liver metastasis, which contributes substantially to high mortality, is the most common recurrent mode of colon carcinoma. Thus, it is necessary to identify genes implicated in metastatic colonization of the liver in colon carcinoma.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared mRNA profiling in 18 normal colon mucosa (N), 20 primary tumors (T) and 19 liver metastases (M) samples from the dataset GSE49355 and GSE62321 of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene ontology (GO) and pathways of the identified genes were analyzed. Co-expression network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were employed to identify the interaction relationship. Survival analyses based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to further screening. Then, the candidate genes were validated by our data.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 22 specific genes related to liver metastasis and they were strongly associated with cell migration, adhesion, proliferation and immune response. Simultaneously, the results showed that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) might be a favorable prediction factor for survival of patients with colon carcinoma. Importantly, our validated data further suggested that lower CXCL14 represented poorer outcome and contributed to metastasis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that CXCL14 was negatively related to the regulation of stem cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).<h4>Conclusions</h4>CXCL14 was identified as a crucial anti-metastasis regulator of colon carcinoma for the first time, and might provide novel therapeutic strategies for colon carcinoma patients to improve prognosis and prevent metastasis.	2018	Identification of liver metastasis-associated genes in human colon carcinoma by mRNA profiling.	30700932	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC6781370	10.1186/s40478-019-0797-0	The majority of the clinico-pathological variability observed in patients harboring a repeat expansion in the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex subunit (C9orf72) remains unexplained. This expansion, which represents the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND), results in a loss of C9orf72 expression and the generation of RNA foci and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. The C9orf72 protein itself plays a role in vesicular transport, serving as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates GTPases. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying C9orf72-related diseases and to identify potential disease modifiers, we performed an extensive RNA sequencing study. We included individuals for whom frontal cortex tissue was available: FTLD and FTLD/MND patients with (n = 34) or without (n = 44) an expanded C9orf72 repeat as well as control subjects (n = 24). In total, 6706 genes were differentially expressed between these groups (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). The top gene was C9orf72 (FDR = 1.41E-14), which was roughly two-fold lower in C9orf72 expansion carriers than in (disease) controls. Co-expression analysis revealed groups of correlated genes (modules) that were enriched for processes such as protein folding, RNA splicing, synaptic signaling, metabolism, and Golgi vesicle transport. Within our cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, machine learning uncovered interesting candidates associated with clinico-pathological features, including age at onset (vascular endothelial growth factor A [VEGFA]), C9orf72 expansion size (cyclin dependent kinase like 1 [CDKL1]), DPR protein levels (eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase [EEF2K]), and survival after onset (small G protein signaling modulator 3 [SGSM3]). Given the fact that we detected a module involved in vesicular transport in addition to a GTPase activator (SGSM3) as a potential modifier, our findings seem to suggest that the presence of a C9orf72 repeat expansion might hamper vesicular transport and that genes affecting this process may modify the phenotype of C9orf72-linked diseases.	2019	Extensive transcriptomic study emphasizes importance of vesicular transport in C9orf72 expansion carriers.	31594549	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC9877488	10.7759/cureus.32980	<h4>Introduction</h4>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) due to its ability to spread inflammatory proteins throughout the nervous system. We hypothesized that filtration of the CSF could remove pathogenic proteins and prevent them from altering motor phenotypes in a mouse model.<h4>Methods</h4>We filtered the CSF from 11 ALS patients via 100 kilodaltons (kD) molecular weight cut-off filters. We used mass spectrometry-based discovery proteomics workflows to compare protein abundances before and after filtration. To test the effects of CSF filtration on motor function, we injected groups of mice with saline, filtered ALS-CSF, or unfiltered ALS-CSF (n=12 per group) and assessed motor function via pole descent and open field tests.<h4>Results</h4>We identified proteins implicated in ALS pathogenesis and showed that these were removed in significant amounts in our workflow. Key filtered proteins included complement proteins, chitinases, serine protease inhibitors, and neuro-inflammatory proteins such as amyloid precursor protein, chromogranin A, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Compared to the filtered ALS-CSF mice, unfiltered ALS-CSF mice took longer to descend a pole (10 days post-injection, 11.14 seconds vs 14.25 seconds, p = 0.02) and explored less on an open field (one day post-injection, 21.81 m vs 16.83 m, p = 0.0004).<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated the ability to filter proteins from the CSF of ALS patients and identified potentially pathologic proteins that were reduced in quantity. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability of unfiltered ALS-CSF to induce motor deficits in mice on the pole descent and open field tests and showed that filtration could prevent this deficit. Given the lack of effective treatments for ALS, this could be a novel solution for patients suffering from this deadly and irreversible condition.	2022	Filtered Cerebrospinal Fluid From Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Displays an Altered Proteome and Affects Motor Phenotype in a Mouse Model.	36712738	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol
PMC5311031	10.1038/onc.2016.279	Recurrent mutations in core splicing factors have been reported in several clonal disorders, including cancers. Mutations in SF3B1, a component of the U2 splicing complex, are the most common. SF3B1 mutations are associated with aberrant pre-mRNA splicing using cryptic 3' splice sites (3'SSs), but the mechanism of their selection is not clear. To understand how cryptic 3'SSs are selected, we performed comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide changes to splicing and gene expression associated with SF3B1 mutations in patient samples as well as an experimental model of inducible expression. Hundreds of cryptic 3'SS were detectable across the genome in cells expressing mutant SF3B1. These 3'SS are typically sequestered within RNA secondary structures and poorly accessible compared with their corresponding canonical 3'SS. We hypothesized that these cryptic 3'SS are inaccessible during normal splicing catalysis and that this constraint is overcome in spliceosomes containing mutant SF3B1. This model of secondary structure-dependent selection of cryptic 3'SS was found across multiple clonal processes associated with SF3B1 mutations (myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia). We validated our model predictions in mini-gene splicing assays. Additionally, we found deregulated expression of proteins with relevant functions in splicing factor-related diseases both in association with aberrant splicing and without corresponding splicing changes. Our results show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with a distinct splicing program shared across multiple clonal processes and define a biochemical mechanism for altered 3'SS choice.	2017	Cancer-associated SF3B1 mutants recognize otherwise inaccessible cryptic 3' splice sites within RNA secondary structures.	27524419	A1BG-AS1	A1BG-AS	primary_symbol

An Indigenous Filipino community that has previously been described with an elevated prevalence of OM that is due to rare <i>A2ML1</i> variants and a common <i>FUT2</i> variant underwent additional phenological testing. In this study, we describe the audiologic profiles in <i>A2ML1</i>- and <i>FUT2</i>-related otitis media and the validity of otoscopy and genotyping for <i>A2ML1</i> and <i>FUT2</i> variants in screening for otitis media and hearing loss. <b><i>Method:</i></b> We analyzed <i>A2ML1</i> and <i>FUT2</i> genotypes together with demographic, otologic and audiologic data from tympanometry and hearing level assessments of 109 indigenous individuals. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We confirmed previous findings of a spectrum of nonsyndromic otitis media as associated with <i>A2ML1</i> variants. <i>A2ML1</i> and <i>FUT2</i> variants were associated with high-frequency hearing loss at 4000 Hz.

PMC10087213	10.1111/jdv.18557	<h4>Background</h4>Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is an extremely rare life-threatening blistering autoimmune disease that is associated with an underlying neoplasm. There is a set diagnostic criterion for PNP, which is primarily based on a severe stomatitis and the detection of specific antibodies against envoplakin, periplakin and alpha-2-macroglobulin-like protein 1. However, it has become increasingly evident that there are patients with PNP that do not meet all the diagnostic criteria requirements.<h4>Objectives</h4>The aim of this study was to analyse our cohort of Dutch patients and to define the atypical cases that did not meet the diagnostic criteria.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective case study of all known Dutch PNP patients of the past 25 years. Patients' clinical and immunological variables were thoroughly analysed and described.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-four patients were included in this study. The results revealed several atypical patient cases that did not completely meet the set diagnostic criteria. Of the 24 patients, two patients presented without stomatitis, in three patients an underlying neoplasm could not be detected, and in two patients the presence of specific autoantibodies could not be demonstrated, although all other criteria for PNP were met. Finally, three of the 24 patients survived the disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although our findings showed similarities to previous studies and most of the patients met the criteria, there were a few atypical patient cases; highlighting the importance of not strictly adhering to the set criteria when making a diagnosis, as this can lead to a missed or late diagnosis. Thus, it is of crucial importance to combine clinical and elaborate laboratory results to confirm the diagnosis of PNP in suspected patients. Although PNP harbours an unfavourable prognosis in most cases, it might be resolved by timely treatment of the underlying cause.	2023	Paraneoplastic pemphigus: A detailed case series from the Netherlands revealing atypical cases.	35993495	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9156758	10.1038/s41467-022-30758-x	A2ML1 is a monomeric protease inhibitor belonging to the A2M superfamily of protease inhibitors and complement factors. Here, we investigate the protease-inhibitory mechanism of human A2ML1 and determine the structures of its native and protease-cleaved conformations. The functional inhibitory unit of A2ML1 is a monomer that depends on covalent binding of the protease (mediated by A2ML1's thioester) to achieve inhibition. In contrast to the A2M tetramer which traps proteases in two internal chambers formed by four subunits, in protease-cleaved monomeric A2ML1 disordered regions surround the trapped protease and may prevent substrate access. In native A2ML1, the bait region is threaded through a hydrophobic channel, suggesting that disruption of this arrangement by bait region cleavage triggers the extensive conformational changes that result in protease inhibition. Structural comparisons with complement C3/C4 suggest that the A2M superfamily of proteins share this mechanism for the triggering of conformational change occurring upon proteolytic activation.	2022	Cryo-EM structures of human A2ML1 elucidate the protease-inhibitory mechanism of the A2M family.	35641520	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

PMC9388621	10.1038/s41598-022-17111-4	Objectives of the present study were to get a deeper insight into the course of the inflammatory pathways of digital dermatitis lesions in dairy cattle by investigating the gene expression patterns throughout the different clinical stages (M0 to M4.1) of the disease. Normal skin samples (M0) were used as a reference for comparing the gene expression levels in the other M-stages through RNA Seq-technology. Principal component analysis revealed a distinct gene expression pattern associated with digital dermatitis lesions in comparison to healthy skin with a further clustering of the acute M1, M2 and M4.1 stages versus the chronic M3 and M4 stages. The majority of the up-and downregulated genes in the acute and chronic stages can be placed into a common 'core' set of genes involved in inflammation, such as A2ML1, PI3, CCL11 and elafin-like protein, whereas the most downregulated genes included keratins and anti-inflammatory molecules such as SCGB1D and MGC151921. Pathway analysis indicated the activation of the pro-inflammatory IL-17 signaling pathway in all the M stages through the upregulation of IL-17F. These results indicate that digital dermatitis is associated with an excessive inflammatory immune response concomitant with a disrupted skin barrier and impaired wound repair mechanism. Importantly, despite their macroscopically healed appearance, a significant inflammatory response (Padj < 0.05) was still measurable in the M3 and M4 lesions, potentially explaining the frequent re-activation of such lesions.	2022	Continuous activation of the IL-17F driven inflammatory pathway in acute and chronic digital dermatitis lesions in dairy cattle.	35982087	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9595068	10.2147/tacg.s372761	<h4>Purpose</h4>Noonan syndrome and related disorders are genetic conditions affecting 1:1000-2000 individuals. Variants causing hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway lead to phenotypic overlap between syndromes, in addition to an increased risk of pediatric tumors. DNA sequencing methods have been optimized to provide a molecular diagnosis for clinical and genetic heterogeneity conditions. This work aimed to investigate the genetic basis in RASopathy patients through Next Generation Sequencing in a Reference Center for Rare Diseases (IFF/Fiocruz) and implement the precision medicine at a public health institute in Brazil.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This study comprises 26 cases with clinical suspicion of RASopathies. Sanger sequencing was used to screen variants in exons usually affected in the <i>PTPN11</i> and <i>HRAS</i> genes for cases with clinical features of Noonan and Costello syndrome, respectively. Posteriorly, negative and new cases with clinical suspicion of RASopathy were analyzed by clinical or whole-exome sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>Molecular analysis revealed recurrent variants and a novel <i>LZTR1</i> missense variant: 24 unrelated individuals with pathogenic variants [<i>PTPN11</i>(11), <i>NF1</i>(2), <i>SOS1</i>(2), <i>SHOC2</i>(2), <i>HRAS</i>(1), <i>BRAF</i>(1), <i>LZTR</i> (1), <i>RAF1</i>(1), <i>KRAS</i>(1), <i>RIT1</i>(1), a patient with co-occurrence of <i>PTPN11</i> and <i>NF1</i> mutations (1)]; familial cases carrying a known pathogenic variant in <i>PTPN11</i> (mother-two children), and a previously undescribed paternally inherited variant in <i>LZTR1</i>. The comparative modeling analysis of the novel <i>LZTR1</i> variant p.Pro225Leu showed local and global changes in the secondary and tertiary structures, showing a decrease of about 1% in the β-sheet content. Furthermore, evolutionary conservation indicated that Pro225 is in a highly conserved region, as observed for known dominant pathogenic variants in this protein.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Bringing precision medicine through NGS towards congenital syndromes promotes a better understanding of complex clinical and/or undiagnosed cases. The National Policy for Rare Diseases in Brazil emphasizes the importance of incorporating and optimizing diagnostic methodologies in the Unified Brazilian Health System (SUS). Therefore, this work is an important step for the NGS inclusion in diagnostic genetic routine in the public health system.	2022	RASopathy Cohort of Patients Enrolled in a Brazilian Reference Center for Rare Diseases: A Novel Familial LZTR1 Variant and Recurrent Mutations.	36304179	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

Nine protease inhibitors were selected for this study: serpin B4, serpin A1, serpin A3, serpin C1, cystatin A, cystatin B, serpin B13, serpin B1 and α-2-macroglobulin-like-protein 1. We assessed in a pilot study, the activity of these antiproteases with cellular assays and an <i>ex vivo</i> HIV-1 challenge model of human ecto-cervical tissue explants. Preliminary findings with both models, cellular and tissue explants, established an order of inhibitory potency for the mucosal proteins as candidates for pre-exposure prophylaxis when mimicking pre-coital use. Combination of all antiproteases considered in this study was more active than any of the individual mucosal proteins. Furthermore, the migration of cells out of ecto-cervical explants was blocked indicating potential prevention of viral dissemination following amplification of the founder population. These findings constitute the base for further development of these mucosal protease inhibitors for prevention strategies.	2022	Pre-clinical evaluation of antiproteases as potential candidates for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis.	36478892	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9729728	10.3389/fmed.2022.1054544	<h4>Background</h4>Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune intraepithelial bullous disease involving the skin and the mucous membranes. Imiquimod, a topical therapy for skin basal cell carcinoma, is an amine that induces the production of tumor necrosis factor alfa, interleukin-1 and other cytokines. Pemphigus induced by drugs has been frequently reported, mostly after systemic therapy.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We present the case of a 50-year-old man who developed skin, intraoral, and genital mucosae lesions 3 days after a treatment with Imiquimod for multiple superficial basal cell carcinoma of the trunk. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence results were compatible with the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was negative for desmoglein 1 and 3, but interestingly, by immunoblotting on keratinocyte extracts a band of 170 kDa was obtained by IgG. The patient, after interrupting Imiquimod application, started a treatment with prednisolone and in 4 weeks showed a complete remission.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Topical Imiquimod therapy might induce atypical pemphigus vulgaris in some patients.	2022	Case report: A rare case of imiquimod-induced atypical pemphigus vulgaris.	36507544	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9352918	10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102230	The protease inhibitor α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (A2M) is a member of the ancient α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin superfamily (A2MF), which also includes structurally related proteins, such as complement factor C3. A2M and other A2MF proteins undergo an extensive conformational change upon cleavage of their bait region by proteases. However, the mechanism whereby cleavage triggers the change has not yet been determined. We have previously shown that A2M remains functional after completely replacing its bait region with glycine and serine residues. Here, we use this tabula rasa bait region to investigate several hypotheses for the triggering mechanism. When tabula rasa bait regions containing disulfide loops were elongated by reducing the disulfides, we found that A2M remained in its native conformation. In addition, cleavage within a disulfide loop did not trigger the conformational change until after the disulfide was reduced, indicating that the introduction of discontinuity into the bait region is essential to the trigger. Previously, A2MF structures have shown that the C-terminal end of the bait region (a.k.a. the N-terminal region of the truncated α chain) threads through a central channel in native A2MF proteins. Bait region cleavage abolishes this plug-in-channel arrangement, as the bait region retracts from the channel and the channel itself collapses. We found that mutagenesis of conserved plug-in-channel residues disrupted the formation of native A2M. These results provide experimental evidence for a structural hypothesis in which retraction of the bait region from this channel following cleavage and the channel's subsequent collapse triggers the conformational change of A2M and other A2MF proteins.	2022	The conformational change of the protease inhibitor α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin is triggered by the retraction of the cleaved bait region from a central channel.	35787371	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
NA	10.1620/tjem.256.27	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) showed limited treatment outcome and poor prognosis. This study aimed to screen potential biomarkers and drugs in ESCC. Firstly, GSE26886, GSE111044 and GSE77861 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Next, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cancer and noncancerous tissues were analyzed by the GEO2R. The Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and hub genes screened were conducted by some bioinformatic methods, respectively. Lastly, the hub genes and potential drugs were verified by the GEPIA2 and the QuartataWeb database. The results showed that 13 up-regulated genes and 81 down-regulated genes were identified. In GO terms, DEGs were mainly associated with cell proliferation, cell migration and cell differentiation. DEGs did not cluster into the KEGG pathway. After hub genes validated, nine genes (FLG, COL1A1, COL1A2, PSCA, SCEL, PPL, ACPP, CNFN, and A2ML1) expression trends showed no change. Moreover, higher COL1A1 or COL1A2 expression for ESCC patients showed poor prognosis. Finally, five drugs used for promoting blood coagulation were identified. Probably, these drugs could show anticancer effects by promoting blood coagulation or inhibiting vascular formation in cancers, which offers a novel idea for the treatment of ESCC.	2022	Mining the Biomarkers and Associated-Drugs for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Bioinformatic Methods.	35067492	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9913072	10.3390/cells12030374	Glioblastoma (GB) is the most prevalent primary brain cancer and the most aggressive form of glioma because of its poor prognosis and high recurrence. To confirm the importance of epigenetics in glioma, we explored The Cancer Gene Atlas (TCGA) database and we found that several histone/DNA modifications and chromatin remodeling factors were affected at transcriptional and genetic levels in GB compared to lower-grade gliomas. We associated these alterations in our own cohort of study with a significant reduction in the bulk levels of acetylated lysines 9 and 14 of histone H3 in high-grade compared to low-grade tumors. Within GB, we performed an RNA-seq analysis between samples exhibiting the lowest and highest levels of acetylated H3 in the cohort; these results are in general concordance with the transcriptional changes obtained after histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition of GB-derived cultures that affected relevant genes in glioma biology and treatment (e.g., <i>A2ML1, CD83</i>, <i>SLC17A7, TNFSF18</i>). Overall, we identified a transcriptional signature linked to histone acetylation that was potentially associated with good prognosis, i.e., high overall survival and low rate of somatic mutations in epigenetically related genes in GB. Our study identifies lysine acetylation as a key defective histone modification in adult high-grade glioma, and offers novel insights regarding the use of HDAC inhibitors in therapy.	2023	Defining a Correlative Transcriptional Signature Associated with Bulk Histone H3 Acetylation Levels in Adult Glioblastomas.	36766715	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9872150	10.3389/fcimb.2022.1057327	<h4>Introduction</h4>Oral microbial homeostasis is a key factor affecting oral health, and saliva plays a significant role in maintaining oral microbial homeostasis. The submandibular gland (SMG) and sublingual gland (SLG) together produce the most saliva at rest. Organic ingredients, including antimicrobial proteins, are rich and distinctive and depend on the type of acinar cells in the SMG and SLG. However, the functions of the SMG and SLG in maintaining oral microbial homeostasis have been difficult to identify and distinguish, given their unique anatomical structures.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we independently removed either the SMG or SLG from mouse models. SMGs were aseptically removed in three mice in the SMG-removal group, and SLGs were aseptically removed in three mice in the SLG-removal group. Three mice from the sham-operated group were only anesthetized and incised the skin. After one month, we analyzed their oral microbiome through 16S rRNA sequencing. And then, we analyzed each gland using proteomics and single-cell RNA sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>Our study revealed that the microbiome balance was significantly disturbed, with decreased bacterial richness, diversity, and uniformity in the groups with the SMG or SLG removed compared with the sham-operated group. We identified eight secreted proteins in the SMG and two in the SLG that could be involved in maintaining oral microbial homeostasis. Finally, we identified multiple types of cells in the SMG and SLG (including serous acinar, mucinous acinar, ductal epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells) that express potential microbiota homeostasis regulatory proteins. Our results suggest that both the SMG and SLG play crucial roles in maintaining oral microbial homeostasis via excretion. Furthermore, the contribution of the SMG in maintaining oral microbial homeostasis appears to be superior to that of the SLG. These findings also revealed the possible antimicrobial function of gland secreta.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our results suggest that control of oral microbial dysbiosis is necessary when the secretory function of the SMG or SLG is impaired. Our study could be the basis for further research on the prevention of oral diseases caused by microbial dysbiosis.	2022	The submandibular and sublingual glands maintain oral microbial homeostasis through multiple antimicrobial proteins.	36704102	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC7940614	10.1038/s41431-020-00743-3	The RASopathies are a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous developmental disorders caused by dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK signalling pathway. Variants in several components and regulators of this pathway have been identified as the pathogenetic cause. In 2015, missense variants in A2ML1 were reported in three unrelated families with clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome (NS) and a zebrafish model was presented showing heart and craniofacial defects similar to those caused by a NS-associated Shp2 variant. However, a causal role of A2ML1 variants in NS has not been confirmed since. Herein, we report on 15 individuals who underwent screening of RASopathy-associated genes and were found to carry rare variants in A2ML1, including variants previously proposed to be causative for NS. In cases where parental DNA was available, the respective A2ML1 variant was found to be inherited from an unaffected parent.

PMC7864068	10.1074/jbc.ra120.015694	Proteins in the α-macroglobulin (αM) superfamily use thiol esters to form covalent conjugation products upon their proteolytic activation. αM protease inhibitors use theirs to conjugate proteases and preferentially react with primary amines (<i>e.g.</i> on lysine side chains), whereas those of αM complement components C3 and C4B have an increased hydroxyl reactivity that is conveyed by a conserved histidine residue and allows conjugation to cell surface glycans. Human α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin-like protein 1 (A2ML1) is a monomeric protease inhibitor but has the hydroxyl reactivity-conveying histidine residue. Here, we have investigated the role of hydroxyl reactivity in a protease inhibitor by comparing recombinant WT A2ML1 and the A2ML1 H1084N mutant in which this histidine is removed. Both of A2ML1s' thiol esters were reactive toward the amine substrate glycine, but only WT A2ML1 reacted with the hydroxyl substrate glycerol, demonstrating that His-1084 increases the hydroxyl reactivity of A2ML1's thiol ester. Although both A2ML1s conjugated and inhibited thermolysin, His-1084 was required for the conjugation and inhibition of acetylated thermolysin, which lacks primary amines. Using MS, we identified an ester bond formed between a thermolysin serine residue and the A2ML1 thiol ester. These results demonstrate that a histidine-enhanced hydroxyl reactivity can contribute to protease inhibition by an αM protein. His-1084 did not improve A2ML1's protease inhibition at pH 5, indicating that A2ML1's hydroxyl reactivity is not an adaption to its acidic epidermal environment.	2020	α<sub>2</sub>-Macroglobulin-like protein 1 can conjugate and inhibit proteases through their hydroxyl groups, because of an enhanced reactivity of its thiol ester.	32978260	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

Prenatal diagnosis of euploid increased NT should include a differential diagnosis of pathogenetic copy number variants and RASopathy disorders (RDs) including Noonan syndrome. Therefore, chromosomal microarray analysis, whole-exome sequencing, RASopathy-disorder testing, and protein-tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 11 gene testing may be necessary under such a circumstance.

PMC8228005	10.3390/life11060510	Capped hock affects the exterior of pedigree pigs, making them unsalable and resulting in a negative impact on the efficiency of pig-breeding centers. The purpose of this paper was to carry out pilot studies aimed at finding genomic regions and genes linked to the capped hock in pigs. The studies were carried out on Landrace pigs (n = 75) and Duroc pigs (n = 70). To identify genomic regions linked to capped hock in pigs, we used smoothing FST statistics. Genotyping was performed with GeneSeek® GGP Porcine HD Genomic Profiler v1 (Illumina Inc, USA). The research results showed 70 SNPs linked to capped hock in Landrace (38 SNPs) and Duroc (32 SNPs). The identified regions overlapped with QTLs related with health traits (blood parameters) and meat and carcass traits (fatness). In total, 31 genes were identified (i.e., 17 genes in Landrace, 14 genes in Durocs). Three genes appeared in both the Landrace and Duroc groups, including A2ML1 (SSC5), ROBO2 (SSC13), and MSI1 (SSC14). We identified genomic regions directly or indirectly linked to capped hock, which thus might contribute to identifying genetic variants and using them as genetic markers in pig breeding.	2021	Genomic Regions and Candidate Genes Linked to Capped Hock in Pig. 	34073088	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
NA	10.1016/j.jdermsci.2020.04.005	<h4>Background</h4>Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a devastating autoimmune multiorgan syndrome associated with autoantibodies against several autoantigens, including the alpha-2-macroglobulin-like-1 (A2ML1). A2ML1 is recognized by up to 70 % of PNP sera. The currently recommended techniques for serological diagnosis of PNP are inadequate to detect anti-A2ML1 antibodies.<h4>Objectives</h4>To develop novel assays which allow to easily and reliably detect anti-A2ML1 autoantibodies in PNP sera.<h4>Methods</h4>We produced full-length A2ML1 in fusion with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-A2ML1) in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 T cells. The recombinant protein was used as fluorescent ligand for immunoprecipitation studies. We further developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by immobilizing EGFP-A2ML1 on 96-well plates.<h4>Results</h4>A2ML1-positive PNP sera were able to immunoprecipitate EGFP-A2ML1. Direct measurement of fluorescence in immunoprecipitates correlates with the relative levels of anti-A2ML1 antibodies in the PNP sera. By the novel ELISA, based on the determined best cut-off value, 61 % of the tested 36 PNP sera were A2ML1 positive with a specificity of 88.9 % and a sensitivity of 95 %. The 20 tested normal sera (NHS) were negative, while 2 (10 %) of 20 pemphigus vulgaris and 3 (15 %) of 20 bullous pemphigoid sera showed borderline values.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our novel immunoassays enable rapid stratification of PNP patients. The novel green fluorescent protein-based ELISA utilizing an active eukaryotic A2ML1 is highly sensitive and reliable and, hence, is useful for a better understanding of the immunological background of PNP. This approach may be easily applied for the rapid detection of antibodies to various other antigens.	2020	Detection of autoantibodies against alpha-2-macroglobulin-like 1 in paraneoplastic pemphigus sera utilizing novel green fluorescent protein-based immunoassays.	32439251	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

PMC9828698	10.3724/abbs.2022112	Adenocarcinoma is the second largest histological type of cervical cancer, second only to cervical squamous cell carcinoma. At present, despite the clinical treatment strategies of cervical adenocarcinoma and cervical squamous cell carcinoma being similar, the outcome and prognosis of cervical adenocarcinoma are significantly poor. Therefore, it is urgent to find specific biomarker and therapeutic target for cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study, we aim to reveal and verify the potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of cervical adenocarcinoma. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) reveals the differentially-expressed genes significantly related to the histological characteristics of the two cervical cancer subtypes. We select the genes with the top 20 significance for further investigation. Through microarray and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of a variety of tumor tissues, we find that among these 20 genes, <i>AHNAK2</i> is highly expressed not only in cervical adenocarcinoma, but also in multiple of adenocarcinoma tissues, including esophagus, breast and colon, while not in normal gland tissues. <i>In vitro</i>, <i>AHNAK2</i> knockdown significantly inhibits cell proliferation and migration of adenocarcinoma cell lines. <i>In vivo</i>, <i>AHNAK2</i> knockdown significantly inhibits tumor progression and metastasis of various adenocarcinomas. RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses suggest that the inhibitory effect of <i>AHNAK2</i> knockdown on tumor progression is achieved by regulating DNA replication and upregulating Bim expression. Together, we demonstrate that AHNAK2 is a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for adenocarcinomas.	2022	AHNAK2 is a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target of adenocarcinomas.	36017889	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

The objective of this study is to investigate the transcriptomes of five key tissues involved in nitrogen metabolism and their changes under different diets to elucidate the molecular regulatory mechanisms of urine urea nitrogen (UUN) yield, one of the indicators of nitrogenous compound secretion of dairy cows.<h4>Results</h4>Cows fed high quality forage-based diet had lower UUN content and UUN yield, compared to those fed low quality forage (crop byproducts) based diets. From the transcriptomes of rumen, duodenum, jejunum, liver and udder, key driver genes and their UUN yield-associated functional gene networks were identified. In addition, the functional networks and expression of key drivers in various tissues (such as S100A8, CA1 and BPIFA2C in the duodenum; A2ML1, HMGCS2 and S100A12 in the jejunum; CYP2B6 and GLYCAM1 in the liver; APOE in the udder) changed in the cows fed crop byproducts based diet, which might be the predominant molecules to drive the increase UUN yield in these cows.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The information suggested that gut, liver and udder play important roles in regulating UUN yield, which could regulate nitrogen excretion waste. These findings provide fundamental information on future nutritional intervention strategies to reduce the UUN yield from dairy cows fed human inedible crop byproducts, which is vital for a sustainable and environmentally friendly dairy industry.	2021	Integrative network analysis revealed molecular mechanisms of urine urea output in lactating dairy cows: Potential solutions to reduce environmental nitrate contamination.	33774166	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC8258961	10.1186/s13023-021-01934-x	<h4>Background</h4>RASopathies are a group of syndromes showing clinical overlap caused by mutations in genes affecting the RAS-MAPK pathway. Consequent disruption on cellular signaling leads and is driven by phosphoproteome remodeling. However, we still lack a comprehensive picture of the different key players and altered downstream effectors.<h4>Methods</h4>An in silico interactome of RASopathy proteins was generated using pathway enrichment analysis/STRING tool, including identification of main hub proteins. We also integrated phosphoproteomic and immunoblotting studies using previous published information on RASopathy proteins and their neighbors in the context of RASopathy syndromes. Data from Phosphosite database ( www.phosphosite.org ) was collected in order to obtain the potential phosphosites subjected to regulation in the 27 causative RASopathy proteins. We compiled a dataset of dysregulated phosphosites in RASopathies, searched for commonalities between syndromes in harmonized data, and analyzed the role of phosphorylation in the syndromes by the identification of key players between the causative RASopathy proteins and the associated interactome.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we provide a curated data set of 27 causative RASopathy genes, identify up to 511 protein-protein associations using pathway enrichment analysis/STRING tool, and identify 12 nodes as main hub proteins. We found that a large group of proteins contain tyrosine residues and their biological processes include but are not limited to the nervous system. Harmonizing published RASopathy phosphoproteomic and immunoblotting studies we identified a total of 147 phosphosites with increased phosphorylation, whereas 47 have reduced phosphorylation. The PKB signaling pathway is the most represented among the dysregulated phosphoproteins within the RASopathy proteins and their neighbors, followed by phosphoproteins implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and the MAPK pathway.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work illustrates the complex network underlying the RASopathies and the potential of phosphoproteomics for dissecting the molecular mechanisms in these syndromes. A combined study of associated genes, their interactome and phosphorylation events in RASopathies, elucidates key players and mechanisms to direct future research, diagnosis and therapeutic windows.	2021	Integrated in silico MS-based phosphoproteomics and network enrichment analysis of RASopathy proteins.	34229750	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC7083932	10.1038/s41598-020-61714-8	While pregnancy-related proteins (PRP) are known to contribute to immunotolerance during pregnancy, their significance to development of invasive placenta is unclear. We compared PRP expression in humans and the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a new-world monkey. Invasive placenta was observed at the maternal-foetal interface of marmoset placenta from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing foetus and wild type mother. The pregnancy zone protein (PZP) and alpha-2 macroglobulin-like 1 (A2ML1) proteins exhibited the most prominent increase in expression during the second trimester in humans and marmoset, respectively. In humans, PZP accumulated at the maternal-foetal interface and A2ML1 accumulated in the amnion. Similarly, A2ML1 mRNA was detected in marmoset placenta. These proteins belong to the A2M family of protease inhibitors, and both PZP and A2ML1 share around 90% homology between human and marmoset and have highly conserved structures. However, the protease-reacting bait regions of the proteins had lower homology (56.8-60.7% in proteins) relative to the rest of the sequence. Notably, the cleavage site of a proinflammatory proline-endopeptidase was preserved in human PZP and marmoset A2ML1. These proteins contain multiple sites that are cleaved by proteases involving proline-endopeptidase. Systemic regulation of these A2M family proteins may be important in animals with invasive placenta.	2020	Human PZP and common marmoset A2ML1 as pregnancy related proteins.	32198464	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

Our goal is to identify novel rare variants that confer OM susceptibility.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed exome and Sanger sequencing of >1000 DNA samples from 551 multiethnic families with OM and unrelated individuals, RNA-sequencing and microbiome sequencing and analyses of swabs from the outer ear, middle ear, nasopharynx and oral cavity. We also examined protein localisation and gene expression in infected and healthy middle ear tissues.<h4>Results</h4>A large, intermarried pedigree that includes 81 OM-affected and 53 unaffected individuals cosegregates two known rare <i>A2ML1</i> variants, a common <i>FUT2</i> variant and a rare, novel pathogenic variant c.1682A>G (p.Glu561Gly) within <i>SPINK5</i> (LOD=4.09). Carriage of the <i>SPINK5</i> missense variant resulted in increased relative abundance of Microbacteriaceae in the middle ear, along with occurrence of Microbacteriaceae in the outer ear and oral cavity but not the nasopharynx. Eight additional novel <i>SPINK5</i> variants were identified in 12 families and individuals with OM. A role for <i>SPINK5</i> in OM susceptibility is further supported by lower RNA counts in variant carriers, strong SPINK5 localisation in outer ear skin, faint localisation to middle ear mucosa and eardrum and increased <i>SPINK5</i> expression in human cholesteatoma.<h4>Conclusion</h4><i>SPINK5</i> variants confer susceptibility to non-syndromic OM. These variants potentially contribute to middle ear pathology through breakdown of mucosal and epithelial barriers, immunodeficiency such as poor vaccination response, alteration of head and neck microbiota and facilitation of entry of opportunistic pathogens into the middle ear.	2021	Otitis media susceptibility and shifts in the head and neck microbiome due to <i>SPINK5</i> variants.	32709676	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

PMC10107879	10.1111/1346-8138.16663	Pemphigus is a life-threatening autoimmune bullous disease mediated by anti-desmoglein IgG autoantibodies. Pemphigus is mainly classified into three subtypes: pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, and paraneoplastic pemphigus. The pathogenicity of autoantibodies has been extensively studied. Anti-human CD20 antibody therapy targeting B cells emerged as a more effective treatment option compared to conventional therapy for patients with an intractable disease. On the other hand, autoreactive T cells are considered to be involved in the pathogenesis based on the test results of human leukocyte antigen association, autoreactive T cell detection, and cytokine profile analysis. Research on the role of T cells in pemphigus has continued to progress, including that on T follicular helper cells, which initiate molecular mechanisms involved in antibody production in B cells. Autoreactive T cell research in mice has highlighted the crucial roles of cellular autoimmunity and improved the understanding of its pathogenesis, especially in paraneoplastic pemphigus. The mouse research has helped elucidate novel regulatory mechanisms of autoreactive T cells, such as thymic tolerance to desmoglein 3 and the essential roles of regulatory T cells, Langerhans cells, and other molecules in peripheral tissues. This review focuses on the immunological aspects of autoreactive T cells in pemphigus by providing detailed information on various related topics.	2023	T cell autoimmunity and immune regulation to desmoglein 3, a pemphigus autoantigen.	36539957	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

Isolated CALMs are defined as multiple café-au-lait macules in patients without any other sign of NF1. Typical CALMs can have predictive significance for NF1, and non-invasive techniques can provide more accurate results for judging whether café-au-lait spots are typical. <b>Objectives:</b> The study aimed to investigate gene mutations in six Chinese Han pedigrees of isolated CALMs and summarize the characteristics of CALMs under dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM). <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we used Sanger sequencing to test for genetic mutations in six families and whole exome sequencing (WES) in two families. We used dermoscopy and RCM to describe the imaging characteristics of CALMs. <b>Results:</b> In this study, we tested six families for genetic mutations, and two mutations were identified as novel mutations. The first family identified [NC_000017.11(NM_001042492.2):c.7355G>A]. The second family identified [NC_000017.11(NM_001042492.2):c.2739_2740del]. According to genotype-phenotype correlation analyses, proband with frameshift mutation tended to have a larger number of CALMs and a higher rate of having atypical CALMs. Dermoscopy showed uniform and consistent tan-pigmented network patches with poorly defined margins with a lighter color around the hair follicles. Under RCM, the appearance of NF1 comprised the increased pigment granules in the basal layer and significantly increased refraction. <b>Conclusion:</b> A new heterozygous mutation and a new frameshift mutation of NF1 were reported.

P < .05 and | logFC | ≥ 1.0 were used for screening DEGs. David (2021 Update) was used to perform GO annotation and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction network of DEGs was constructed using the STRING database, in which hub genes were mined through Cytoscape software.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 326 DEGs were identified, including 287 up-regulated genes and 39 down-regulated genes. The GO biological processes enriched by DEGs mainly involved epidermal growth, keratinization and intermediate fibrous tissue. The DEGs were significantly enriched in intracellular insoluble membranes, desmosomes and extracellular space. Their molecular functions mainly focused on structural molecular activity, structural components of epidermis and structural components of cytoskeleton. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and tight junction were highlighted as critical pathways enriched by DEGs. Ten hub genes which included KRT14, EGF, DSP, DSG1, KRT16, KRT6A, EPCAM, SPRR1B, PKP1, and PPL were identified from the constructed protein-protein interaction network.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A total of 326 DEGs and 10 hub genes were identified as candidates for metabolic disorders in LBW individuals. Our results indicated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway as an intrauterine adaptive mechanism for LBW individuals. We observed activated PI3K/AKT pathway in LBW individuals, which would promote growth and development at the early stage of life, but adversely introduce extra metabolic stress and thereby potentially induce metabolic disorders in adulthood.	2022	Network exploration of gene signatures underlying low birth weight induced metabolic alterations.	36316897	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC7608271	10.1038/s41431-020-0658-0	Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder with variable expressivity and locus heterogeneity. Despite several RAS pathway genes were implicated in NS, 20-30% of patients remain without molecular diagnosis, suggesting the involvement of further genes or multiple mechanisms. Eight patients out of 60, negative for conventional NS mutation analysis, with heterogeneous NS phenotype were investigated by means of target resequencing of 26 RAS/MAPK pathway genes. A trio was further characterized by means of whole-exome sequencing. Protein modeling and in silico prediction of protein stability allowed to identify possible pathogenic RAS pathway variants in four NS patients. A new c.355T>C variant in LZTR1 was found in patient 43. Two patients co-inherited variants in LRP1 and LZTR1 (patient 53), or LRP1 and SOS1 genes (patient 67). The forth patient (56) carried a compound heterozygote of RASAL3 gene variants and also an A2ML1 variant. While these subclinical variants are singularly present in healthy parents, they co-segregate in patients, suggesting their addictive effect and supporting a digenic inheritance, as alternative model to a more common monogenic transmission. The ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK activation state, assessed on immortalized lymphocytes from patients 53 and 67 showed highest phosphorylation levels compared to their asymptomatic parents. These findings together with the lack of their co-occurrence in the 1000Genomes database strengthen the hypothesis of digenic inheritance in a subset of NS patients. This study suggests caution in the exclusion of subclinical variants that might play a pathogenic role providing new insights for alternative hereditary mechanisms.	2020	Digenic inheritance of subclinical variants in Noonan Syndrome patients: an alternative pathogenic model?	32514133	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

PHPT was diagnosed on routine blood testing (ionized calcium, 1.66 [1.12-1.32] mmol/L; PTH 110 pg/mL, vitamin D-25-OH-D: 18 ng/mL; PTHrP: undetectable). Medical history was notable for 2 reoccurrences of PHPT with persistent disease after most recent parathyroidectomy. Lymph node (LN) dissection during this last surgery showed a 2-mm focus of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in 1/5 LNs. Additionally, the patient had a history of multifocal GCTs diagnosed at age 2 years. On examination, there were no Lisch nodules, axillary, or inguinal freckling, neurofibromas, or café-au-lait macules but a prominent abdominal wall nodule was noted. En bloc resection of a tumor in the tracheoesophageal groove, identified by sestamibi scan, and excision of 4.5-cm abdominal wall nodule showed both masses having histology consistent with GCT. Serum calcium and PTH did not decrease, indicating another unsuccessful surgery. Genetic testing was negative for germline variants in PHPT-associated genes, <i>APC,</i> or genes of RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. The LN finding of metastatic adenocarcinoma prompted an endoscopy and transbronchial biopsy leading to the diagnosis of widely metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma, eventually resulting in his death a year later. The source of the patient's persistent PHPT remained unidentified. This is the first case with coassociation of recurrent PHPT, multifocal GCT, and colon cancer. Whether the disparate tumors in this patient share common driver(s) remains unknown. Prospective surveillance of patients for similar associations may provide clues for a novel syndromic form of PHPT.	2022	Case of Recurrent Primary Hyperparathyroidism, Congenital Granular Cell Tumor, and Aggressive Colorectal Cancer.	35811576	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9735269	10.1016/j.csbj.2022.11.054	Obesity affects the function of multiple organs/tissues including the exocrine organ salivary glands. However, the effects of obesity on transcriptomes and cell compositions in the salivary glands have yet been studied by bulk RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Besides, the cell types in the sublingual gland, one of the three major salivary glands, have yet been characterized by the approach of single-cell RNA-sequencing. In this report, we find that the histological structure of the three major salivary glands are not obviously affected in the obese mice. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis shows that the most prominent changes observed in the three major salivary glands of the obese mice are the mobilization of transcriptomes related to the immune response and down-regulation of genes related to the secretory function of the salivary glands. Based on single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, we identify and annotate 17 cell clusters in the sublingual gland for the first time, and find that obesity alters the relative compositions of immune cells and secretory cells in the major glands of obese mice. Integrative analysis of the bulk RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing data confirms the activation of immune response genes and compromise of secretory function in the three major salivary glands of obese mice. Consequently, the secretion of extracellular matrix proteins is significantly reduced in the three major salivary glands of obese mice. These results provide new molecular insights into understanding the effect of obesity on salivary glands.	2023	Bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq analysis reveal an activation of immune response and compromise of secretory function in major salivary glands of obese mice.	36544475	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC10094043	10.3390/ijms24076259	The evidence supporting the biological plausibility of the association of permethrin and malathion with hematological cancer is limited and contradictory; thus, further studies are needed. This study aimed to investigate whether in vitro exposure to 0.1 μM permethrin and malathion at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after cell culture initiation induced changes in the gene expression and DNA methylation in mononuclear cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood (BMMCs, PBMCs). Both pesticides induced several gene expression modifications in both tissues. Through gene ontology analysis, we found that permethrin deregulates ion channels in PBMCs and BMMCs and that malathion alters genes coding proteins with nucleic acid binding capacity, which was also observed in PBMCs exposed to permethrin. Additionally, we found that both insecticides deregulate genes coding proteins with chemotaxis functions, ion channels, and cytokines. Several genes deregulated in this study are potentially associated with cancer onset and development, and some of them have been reported to be deregulated in hematological cancer. We found that permethrin does not induce DNA hypermethylation but can induce hypomethylation, and that malathion generated both types of events. Our results suggest that these pesticides have the potential to modify gene expression through changes in promoter DNA methylation and potentially through other mechanisms that should be investigated.	2023	Exposure to Insecticides Modifies Gene Expression and DNA Methylation in Hematopoietic Tissues In Vitro.	37047231	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC6711784	10.1002/humu.23769	A genetic basis for otitis media is established, however, the role of rare variants in disease etiology is largely unknown. Previously a duplication variant within A2ML1 was identified as a significant risk factor for otitis media in an indigenous Filipino population and in US children. In this report exome and Sanger sequencing was performed using DNA samples from the indigenous Filipino population, Filipino cochlear implantees, US probands, Finnish, and Pakistani families with otitis media. Sixteen novel, damaging A2ML1 variants identified in otitis media patients were rare or low-frequency in population-matched controls. In the indigenous population, both gingivitis and A2ML1 variants including the known duplication variant and the novel splice variant c.4061 + 1 G>C were independently associated with otitis media. Sequencing of salivary RNA samples from indigenous Filipinos demonstrated lower A2ML1 expression according to the carriage of A2ML1 variants. Sequencing of additional salivary RNA samples from US patients with otitis media revealed differentially expressed genes that are highly correlated with A2ML1 expression levels. In particular, RND3 is upregulated in both A2ML1 variant carriers and high-A2ML1 expressors. These findings support a role for A2ML1 in keratinocyte differentiation within the middle ear as part of otitis media pathology and the potential application of ROCK inhibition in otitis media.	2019	A2ML1 and otitis media: novel variants, differential expression, and relevant pathways.	31009165	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC7191070	10.3389/fgene.2020.00313	Otitis media (OM) is an infective and inflammatory disorder known to be a major cause of hearing impairment across all age groups. Both acute and chronic OM result in substantial healthcare utilization related to antibiotic prescription and surgical procedures necessary for its management. Although several studies provided evidence of genetics playing a significant role in the susceptibility to OM, we had limited knowledge about the genes associated with OM until recently. Here we have summarized the known genetic factors that confer susceptibility to various forms of OM in mice and in humans and their genetic load, along with associated cellular signaling pathways. Spotlighted in this review are fucosyltransferase (FUT) enzymes, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of OM. A comprehensive understanding of the functions of OM-associated genes may provide potential opportunities for its diagnosis and treatment.	2020	Genomics of Otitis Media (OM): Molecular Genetics Approaches to Characterize Disease Pathophysiology.	32391049	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC10107560	10.1111/1346-8138.16660	The major autoantigens for pemphigus are desmogleins (Dsgs), cell-cell adhesive structure proteins, one of the desmosomal cadherins. Recent progress in molecular biology has revealed that IgG autoantibodies of classical pemphigus react with Dsg1 or Dsg3. Desmocollins (Dscs) also belong to the cadherin supergene family that provides structure to the desmosomes and play an important role in cell-to-cell adhesion. In addition to the presence of four desmosomal Dsg isoforms, i.e. Dsg1-4, Dsc1, 2 and 3, all of which are derived from different genes, Dsc1 has been previously identified as the target antigen of IgA autoantibodies in the subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD)-type of intercellular IgA dermatosis. In addition to the IgA anti-Dsc1 autoantiboides, the presence of IgG anti-Dsc autoantibodies is described in patients of some autoimmune bullous diseases. In particular, the current pemphigus detecting autoantibodies to Dscs has shown a tendency in atypical variants of pemphigus. Therefore, autoantibodies against Dscs alone may cause detachment of cell-cell adhesion in the epidermis in some pemphigus. However, except for the findings of a few in vitro and in vivo studies, there is currently no clear evidence for the pathogenicity of anti-Dsc autoantibodies in pemphigus, whereas significance of anti-Dsg autoantibodies is well established. This article describes the structure and function of the Dscs, and explores the evidence regarding the pathogenic role of anti-Dsc autoantibodies in pemphigus.	2023	Significance of anti-desmocollin autoantibodies in pemphigus.	36578135	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC8631809	10.3389/fgene.2021.784176	To investigate the correlation between gene mutation and knee osteoarthritis (KOA), a whole-exome sequencing (WES) was applied to analyze blood samples of four KOA patients and two normal subjects in a family. Gene mutations were identified by gene-trapping and high-throughput sequencing analysis across the differences between the patients and normal subjects. The interactive gene network analysis on the retrieval of interacting genes (STRING) database and the KOA-related genes expression data sets was performed. A possibly detrimental and nonsynonymous mutation at the kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6) gene (rs201586262, c. C80A, P27H) was identified and attracted our attention. KLK6 belongs to the kallikrein family of serine proteases and its serum level is known as a prevalent biomarker in inflammatory and malignant diseases. KLK6 expresses in the extracellular compartment for matrix degradation, highlighting that KLK6 plays a role in the pathogenesis of KOA. By using the gene databases, the KOA-related genes were mined after de-duplication and IL6 was selected as the most relevant gene through interactive analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The data suggested that KLK6 gene mutation and the related expression alteration of IL6 gene might determine the occurrence of hereditary KOA. The is the first study discovering the gene mutation of KLK6 as a factor of pathogenesis of KOA, especially the hereditary KOA.	2021	A Novel Mutation of the KLK6 Gene in a Family With Knee Osteoarthritis.	34858488	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC7650485	NA	Abstract <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4> Spinal Neurofibromatosis (SNF), a distinct clinical entity of NF1, characterized by bilateral neurofibromas involving all spinal roots and a few, if any, cutaneous manifestations, entails greater morbidity than the classical form of disease. Nevertheless, there are no reliable patterns to sort out patients at risk for developing SNF. <h4>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h4> We investigated 19 NF1 families with at least one SNF member, 37 sporadic SNF patient and 100 NF1 patients with classical form of disease. We applied Targeted NGS using a panel consisting of 139 genes encoding RAS pathway effectors, neurofibromin interactors and genes mapping at 17q11.2 region. <h4>RESULTS</h4> In SNF patients we found a higher percentage of missense (21% versus 8%, p=0 0.016, OR 3.13 (95% CI 01.1 -8.2) and a lower percentage of nonsense NF1 mutations (12.5% versus 28%,, p= 0.026, OR 0.36 (95% CI 0.14–0.9) than in classical NF1 cases. Furthermore, we evaluated rare variants with damaging potential predictors in genes of the RAS pathway and in neurofibromin interactors. In more than one sporadic case possible pathogenic variants were found in LIMK2 (neurofibromin interactor), RASAL1, RASAL3, SOS1, A2ML1, MAP3K1 (RAS pathway effectors), while in more than one SNF family were detected RASAL1, RASAL3, MAP3K1 genes variations. <h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4> Our results confirm the correlation between NF1 genotype and SNF phenotype as previously reported (Ruggieri, 2015), suggesting that neurofibromin gain-of-functions mutations are associated to SNF. In some patients, the co-occurrence of potential pathogenic variants in NF1 related genes with severe phenotypes was detected supporting their role as modifier genes and promising therapeutic targets.	2020	BIOM-10.

PMC9016468	10.1210/clinem/dgac010	<h4>Context</h4>Anemia during early pregnancy (EP) is common in developing countries and is associated with adverse health consequences for both mothers and children. Offspring of women with EP anemia often have low birth weight, which increases risk for cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), later in life.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to elucidate mechanisms underlying developmental programming of adult cardiometabolic disease, including epigenetic and transcriptional alterations potentially detectable in umbilical cord blood (UCB) at time of birth.<h4>Methods</h4>We leveraged global transcriptome- and accompanying epigenome-wide changes in 48 UCB from newborns of EP anemic Tanzanian mothers and 50 controls to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in UCB exposed to maternal EP anemia. DEGs were assessed for association with neonatal anthropometry and cord insulin levels. These genes were further studied in expression data from human fetal pancreas and adult islets to understand their role in beta-cell development and/or function.<h4>Results</h4>The expression of 137 genes was altered in UCB of newborns exposed to maternal EP anemia. These putative signatures of fetal programming, which included the birth weight locus LCORL, were potentially mediated by epigenetic changes in 27 genes and associated with neonatal anthropometry. Among the DEGs were P2RX7, PIK3C2B, and NUMBL, which potentially influence beta-cell development. Insulin levels were lower in EP anemia-exposed UCB, supporting the notion of developmental programming of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and subsequently increased risk of T2D in offspring of mothers with EP anemia.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data provide proof-of-concept on distinct transcriptional and epigenetic changes detectable in UCB from newborns exposed to maternal EP anemia.	2022	Mapping the Cord Blood Transcriptome of Pregnancies Affected by Early Maternal Anemia to Identify Signatures of Fetal Programming.	35021220	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

To date, the closely related genes to <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations in breast cancer remains to be fully elucidated. This study aims to identify the gene expression profiles and interaction networks influenced by <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations, so as to reflect underlying disease mechanisms and provide new biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis or prognosis.<h4>Methods</h4>Gene expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were downloaded and combined with cBioPortal website to identify exact breast cancer patients with <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to analyze some enriched pathways and biological processes associated <i>BRCA</i> mutations. For <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutant breast cancer, wild-type breast cancer and corresponding normal tissues, three independent differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis were performed to validate potential hub genes with each other. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, survival analysis and diagnostic value assessment helped identify key genes associated with <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations.<h4>Results</h4>The regulation process of cell cycle was significantly enriched in mutant group compared with wild-type group. A total of 294 genes were identified after analysis of DEGs between mutant patients and wild-type patients. Interestingly, by the other two comparisons, we identified 43 overlapping genes that not only significantly expressed in wild-type breast cancer patients relative to normal tissues, but more significantly expressed in <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutant breast patients. Based on the STRING database and cytoscape software, we constructed a PPI network using 294 DEGs. Through topological analysis scores of the PPI network and 43 overlapping genes, we sought to select some genes, thereby using survival analysis and diagnostic value assessment to identify key genes pertaining to <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutant breast cancer. <i>CCNE1</i>, <i>NPBWR1</i>, <i>A2ML1</i>, <i>EXO1</i> and <i>TTK</i> displayed good prognostic/diagnostic value for breast cancer and <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutant breast cancer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our research provides comprehensive and new insights for the identification of biomarkers connected with <i>BRCA</i> mutations, availing diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutant breast cancer patients.	2020	Differentially expressed genes and key molecules of <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutant breast cancer: evidence from bioinformatics analyses.	31998560	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC10218275	10.3390/ijms24108648	Nutrition and energy levels have an important impact on animal growth, production performance, disease occurrence and health recovery. Previous studies indicate that melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) is mainly involved in the regulations of exocrine gland function, lipid metabolism and immune response in animals. However, it is not clear how MC5R participates in the nutrition and energy metabolism of animals. To address this, the widely used animal models, including the overfeeding model and the fasting/refeeding model, could provide an effective tool. In this study, the expression of <i>MC5R</i> in goose liver was first determined in these models. Goose primary hepatocytes were then treated with nutrition/energy metabolism-related factors (glucose, oleic acid and thyroxine), which is followed by determination of <i>MC5R</i> gene expression. Moreover, <i>MC5R</i> was overexpressed in goose primary hepatocytes, followed by identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways subjected to MC5R regulation by transcriptome analysis. At last, some of the genes potentially regulated by MC5R were also identified in the in vivo and in vitro models, and were used to predict possible regulatory networks with PPI (protein-protein interaction networks) program. The data showed that both overfeeding and refeeding inhibited the expression of <i>MC5R</i> in goose liver, while fasting induced the expression of <i>MC5R</i>. Glucose and oleic acid could induce the expression of <i>MC5R</i> in goose primary hepatocytes, whereas thyroxine could inhibit it. The overexpression of <i>MC5R</i> significantly affected the expression of 1381 genes, and the pathways enriched with the DEGs mainly include oxidative phosphorylation, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, glutathione metabolism and MAPK signaling pathway. Interestingly, some pathways are related to glycolipid metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, citrate cycle, etc. Using the in vivo and in vitro models, it was demonstrated that the expression of some DEGs, including <i>ACSL1</i>, <i>PSPH</i>, <i>HMGCS1</i>, <i>CPT1A</i>, <i>PACSIN2</i>, <i>IGFBP3</i>, <i>NMRK1</i>, <i>GYS2</i>, <i>ECI2</i>, <i>NDRG1</i>, <i>CDK9</i>, <i>FBXO25</i>, <i>SLC25A25</i>, <i>USP25</i> and <i>AHCY</i>, was associated with the expression of <i>MC5R</i>, suggesting these genes may mediate the biological role of MC5R in these models. In addition, PPI analysis suggests that the selected downstream genes, including <i>GYS2</i>, <i>ECI2</i>, <i>PSPH</i>, <i>CPT1A</i>, <i>ACSL1</i>, <i>HMGCS1</i>, <i>USP25</i> and <i>NDRG1</i>, participate in the protein-protein interaction network regulated by <i>MC5R</i>. In conclusion, MC5R may mediate the biological effects caused by changes in nutrition and energy levels in goose hepatocytes through multiple pathways, including glycolipid-metabolism-related pathways.	2023	Study on the Mechanism of MC5R Participating in Energy Metabolism of Goose Liver.	37239994	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9682263	10.3389/fgene.2022.1030886	Chicken is widely accepted by consumers because of its delicate taste and abundant animal protein. The rooster after castration (capon) is believed to show better flavor, however, the molecular changes of the underpinned metabolism after castration is not yet understood. In this study, we aimed to figure out the alternation of meat quality and underpinned molecular mechanism <i>via</i> transcriptomic profiling of liver, spleen and hypothalamus as targeted organs in response to the castration. We identified differential expressed genes and their enriched functions and pathways in these organs between capon and rooster samples through RNA-seq analysis. In the liver, the lipid metabolism with targeted <i>FABP1</i>gene was found significantly enriched, which may be as one of the factors contributing to increased fat deposition and thus better meat flavor in capons than roosters, as predicted by the significantly lower shear force in capons than in roosters in meat quality experiments. However, the ability to xenobiotic detoxification and excretion, vitamin metabolism, and antioxidative effect of hemoglobin evidenced of the capon may be compromised by the alternation of <i>SULT</i>, <i>AOX1</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>HBA1</i>, <i>HBBA</i>, and <i>HBAD</i>. Besides, in both the spleen and hypothalamus, <i>PTAFR</i>, <i>HPX</i>, <i>CTLA4</i>, <i>LAG3</i>, <i>ANPEP</i>, <i>CD24</i>, <i>ITGA2B</i>, <i>ITGB3</i>, <i>CD2</i>, <i>CD7</i>, and <i>BLB2</i> may play an important role in the immune system including function of platelet and T cell, development of monocyte/macrophage and B cell in capons as compared to roosters. In conclusion, our study sheds lights into the possible molecular mechanism of better meat flavor, fatty deposit, oxidative detoxification and immune response difference between capons and roosters.	2022	The transcriptome pattern of liver, spleen and hypothalamus provides insights into genetic and biological changes in roosters in response to castration.	36437959	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

Survival is limited for patients with LSCC. To identify more biomarkers associated with the prognosis of patients with LSCC, using bioinformatics analysis, this study used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LSCC dataset and gene expression profiles of GSE59102 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Eighty-one differentially co-expressed genes were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Next, 10 hub genes (PPL, KRT78, CRNN, PTK7, SCEL, AGRN, SPINK5, AIF1L, EMP1, and PPP1R3C) were screened from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Based on survival analysis, SPINK5 was significantly correlated with survival time in LSCC patients. After verification in the TCGA and HPA databases, SPINK5 was selected as a prognostic biomarker. Finally, the GSEA results showed that downregulation of SPINK5 gene expression may promote tumorigenesis and the development of cancers by the ""BASAL CELL CARCINOMA"" pathway, and it has been implicated in disrupting DNA damage and repair pathways.

PMC8855930	10.3389/fmolb.2021.808536	Pemphigus represents a group of rare and severe autoimmune intra-epidermal blistering diseases affecting the skin and mucous membranes. These painful and debilitating diseases are driven by the production of autoantibodies that are mainly directed against the desmosomal adhesion proteins, desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) and desmoglein 1 (Dsg1). The search to define underlying triggers for anti-Dsg-antibody production has revealed genetic, environmental, and possible vaccine-driven factors, but our knowledge of the processes underlying disease initiation and pathology remains incomplete. Recent studies point to an important role of T cells in supporting auto-antibody production; yet the involvement of the myeloid compartment remains unexplored. Clinical management of pemphigus is beginning to move away from broad-spectrum immunosuppression and towards B-cell-targeted therapies, which reduce many patients' symptoms but can have significant side effects.

PMC9846079	10.3389/fgene.2022.1058062	<b>Background:</b> Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is one of the most aggressive tumors of the digestive tract, with low surgical resection rate and insensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Existing evidence suggests that regulation of ferroptosis can induce PAAD cell death, inhibit tumor growth, and may synergistically improve the sensitivity of other antitumor drugs. However, there is little of systematic research on iron metabolism-related genes in PAAD. In this study, a risk-score system of PAAD iron metabolism-related genes was designed and tested, and verified to be robust. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The TCGA database was used to download 177 PAAD patients' message RNA (mRNA) expression profiles and clinical characteristics. By identifying dysregulated iron metabolism-related genes between PAAD related tissues and adjacent normal tissues, univariate Cox proportional hazards regression and LASSO regression algorithm were used to establish prognostic risk-score system and construct nomogram to estimate the 1-, 2-, 3-year survival in PAAD patients. Finally, selected genes were validated by quantitative PCR (q-PCR). <b>Results:</b> A 9-gene related to iron metabolism risk-score system of PAAD was constructed and validated. The clinicopathological characteristics of age, histologic grade, pathologic stage, T stage, residual tumor, and primary therapy outcome were all worse in patients with a higher risk-score. Further, immunohistochemistry results of <i>SLC2A1</i>, <i>MBOAT2</i>, <i>XDH</i>, <i>CTSE</i>, <i>MOCOS</i>, and <i>ATP6V0A4</i> confirmed that patients with higher expression are more malignant. Then, a nomogram with 9-gene risk score system as a separate clinical factor was utilized to foretell the 1-, 2-, 3-year overall survival rate of PAAD patients. Results of q-PCR showed that 8 of the 9 genes screened were significantly up-regulated in at least one PAAD cell line, and one gene was significantly down-regulated in three PAAD cell lines. <b>Conclusion:</b> To conclude, we generated a nine-gene system linked to iron metabolism as an independent indicator for predicting PAAD prognosis, therefore presenting a possible prognostic biomarker and potential treatment targets for PAAD.	2022	Development and validation of a prognostic prediction model for iron metabolism-related genes in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	36685915	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9959625	10.3390/ijms24044035	Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder, characterized by variable expressivity and locus heterogeneity, being caused by mutations in one of a subset of RAS pathway genes. Nevertheless, for 20-30% of patients it is not possible to provide molecular diagnosis, suggesting that further unknown genes or mechanisms are involved in NS pathogenesis. Recently, we proposed a digenic inheritance of subclinical variants as an alternative NS pathogenic model in two NS patients negative for molecular diagnosis. They showed hypomorphic variants of RAS pathway genes co-inherited from both their healthy parents that we hypothesized to generate an additive effect. Here, we report on the phosphoproteome and proteome analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) performed on the immortalized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the two above trios. Our results indicate that the two unrelated patients show overlapped profiles in both protein abundances and their phosphorylation levels not reached by their parents. IPA software predicted RAS-related pathways as significantly activated in the two patients. Interestingly, they remained unchanged or only slightly activated in both patients' parents. These findings suggest that the presence of one subclinical variant can activate the RAS pathway below the pathological threshold, which can instead be exceeded by the additive effect due to the co-presence of two subclinical variants causing NS, supporting our digenic inheritance hypothesis.	2023	Changes of RAS Pathway Phosphorylation in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines from Noonan Syndrome Patients Carrying Hypomorphic Variants in Two NS Genes.	36835447	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

But the initial presentation of NS could be significant variant individually which results in the difficult of working diagnosis. Here we report a rare neonatal case of NS who presented with refractory thrombocytopenia as the initial manifestation.<h4>Case presentation</h4>This was a preterm infant with refractory thrombocytopenia of unknown origin transferred from obstetric hospital at 6 weeks of age. During hospitalization, typical phenotypes of NS in addition to thrombocytopenia were observed, such as typical facial characteristics, short stature, atrial septal defect, cryptochidism, coagulation defect and chylothorax. Genetic testing showed a pathogenic variant at exon 2 of the PTPN11 gene with c.124A > G (p.T42A). Respiratory distress was deteriorated with progressive chylothorax. Chest tube was inserted for continuous draining. Chemical pleurodesis with erythromycin was tried twice, but barely effective. Finally, parents decided to withdraw medical care and the patient died.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Thrombocytopenia could be the first symptom of Noonan syndrome. After ruling out other common causes of thrombocytopenia, NS should be considered as the working diagnosis.	2022	Refractory thrombocytopenia could be a rare initial presentation of Noonan syndrome in newborn infants: a case report and literature review.	35300644	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC6930242	10.3389/fimmu.2019.02948	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection in humans can cause active disease or latent infection. However, the factors contributing to the maintenance of latent infection vs. disease progression are poorly understood. In this study, we used a genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach to identify host factors associated with M. tuberculosis infection status and a novel gene signature that can distinguish active disease from latent infection. By RNA-seq, we characterized transcriptional differences in purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) among three groups: patients with active tuberculosis (ATB), individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), and TB-uninfected controls (CON). A total of 401 differentially expressed genes enabled grouping of individuals into three clusters. A validation study by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed the differential expression of TNFRSF10C, IFNG, PGM5, EBF3, and A2ML1 between the ATB and LTBI groups. Additional clinical validation was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these five biomarkers using 130 subjects. The 3-gene signature set of TNFRSF10C, EBF3, and A2ML1 enabled correct classification of 91.5% of individuals, with a high sensitivity of 86.2% and specificity of 94.9%. Diagnostic performance of the 3-gene signature set was validated using a clinical cohort of 147 subjects with suspected ATB. The sensitivity and specificity of the 3-gene set for ATB were 82.4 and 92.4%, respectively. In conclusion, we detected distinct gene expression patterns in PBMCs stimulated by PPD depending on the status of M. tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, we identified a 3-gene signature set that could distinguish ATB from LTBI, which may facilitate rapid diagnosis and treatment for more effective disease control.	2019	Transcriptional Profiling of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Identifies Diagnostic Biomarkers That Distinguish Active and Latent Tuberculosis.	31921195	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

Previous studies have demonstrated that ancestral BaP exposure can cause transgenerational bone deformities in fish. Transgenerational effects are thought to be caused by heritable epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in BaP-induced transgenerational skeletal deformities and the related transcriptomic changes in deformed vertebrae, we examined the vertebrae of male F1 and F3 medaka fish using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS). The histological results revealed that osteoblast numbers at the vertebral bone decreased in the BaP-derived F1 and F3 adult males in comparison with the control group. Differentially methylated genes (DMGs) associated with osteoblastogenesis (F1 and F3), chondrogenesis (F1 and F3), and osteoclastogenesis (F3) were identified. However, RNA-seq data did not support the role of DNA methylation in the regulation of genes involved in skeletogenesis since there was very little correlation between the level of differential methylation and gene expression profiles related to skeletogenesis. Although DNA methylation plays a major role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, the dysregulation of vertebral gene expression patterns observed in the current study is most likely to be mediated by histone modification and miRNAs. Notably, RNA-seq and WGBS data indicated that genes related to nervous system development are more sensitive to ancestral BaP exposure, indicating a more complex transgenerational phenotype in response to ancestral BaP exposure.	2023	The role of DNA methylation on gene expression in the vertebrae of ancestrally benzo[a]pyrene exposed F1 and F3 male medaka.	37322851	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

Animal models and human genetics studies have identified many genes and gene variants associated with OM susceptibility: genes that encode components of multiple signaling pathways involved in host immunity and inflammatory responses of the ME mucosa; genes involved in cellular function, such as mucociliary transport, mucin production, and mucous cell metaplasia; and genes that are essential for Eustachian tube (ET) development, ME cavitation, and homeostasis. Since our last review, several new mouse models with mutations in genes such as CCL3, IL-17A, and Nisch have been reported. Moreover, genetic variants and polymorphisms in several genes, including FNDC1, FUT2, A2ML1, TGIF1, CD44, and IL1-RA variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) allele 2, have been identified as being significantly associated with OM. In this review, we focus on the current understanding of the role of host genetics in OM, including recent discoveries and future research prospects. Further studies on the genes identified thus far and the discovery of new genes using advanced technologies such as gene editing, next generation sequencing, and genome-wide association studies, will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of OM and provide new avenues for early screening and developing effective preventative and therapeutic strategies to treat OM.	2019	Current Understanding of Host Genetics of Otitis Media.	32117425	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC8240953	10.18332/tid/138336	<h4>Introduction</h4>Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease. Although smoking results in an acute effect of relaxation and positive mood through dopamine release, smoking is thought to increase stress symptoms such as heart rate and blood pressure from nicotine-induced effects on the HPA axis and increased cortisol. Despite the importance in understanding the mechanisms in smoking maintenance, little is known about the overall protein and physiological response to smoking. There may be multiple functions involved that if identified might help in improving methods for behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Therefore, our goal for this pilot study was to identify proteins in the saliva that change in response to an acute smoking event versus acute sham smoking event in smokers and non-smokers, respectively.<h4>Methods</h4>We employed the iTRAQ technique followed by Mass Spectrometry to identify differentially expressed proteins in saliva of smokers and non-smokers after smoking cigarettes and sham smoking, respectively. We also validated some of the salivary proteins by ELISA or western blotting. In addition, salivary cortisol and salivary amylase (sAA) activity were measured.<h4>Results</h4>In all, 484 salivary proteins were identified. Several proteins were elevated as well as decreased in smokers compared to non-smokers. Among these were proteins associated with stress response including fibrinogen alpha, cystatin A and sAA. Our investigation also highlights methodological considerations in study design, sampling and iTRAQ analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We suggest further investigation of other differentially expressed proteins in this study including ACBP, A2ML1, APOA4, BPIB1, BPIA2, CAH1, CAH6, CYTA, DSG1, EST1, GRP78, GSTO1, sAA, SAP, STAT, TCO1, and TGM3 that might assist in improving methods for behavioral and pharmacological interventions for smokers.	2021	Changes in salivary proteome before and after cigarette smoking in smokers compared to sham smoking in nonsmokers: A pilot study.	34239408	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9542063	10.1002/gcc.23086	Lateralized/segmental overgrowth disorders (LOs) encompass a heterogeneous group of congenital conditions with excessive body tissue growth. Documented molecular alterations in LOs mostly consist of somatic variants in genes of the PI3KCA/AKT/mTOR pathway or of chromosome band 11p15.5 imprinted region anomalies. In some cases, somatic pathogenic variants in genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway have been reported. We present the first case of a somatic pathogenic variant (T507K) in PTPN11 causing a LO phenotype characterized by severe lateralized overgrowth, vascular proliferation, and cerebral astrocytoma. The T507K variant was detected in DNA from overgrown tissue in a leg with capillary malformation. The astrocytoma tissue showed a higher PTPN11 variant allele frequency. A pathogenic variant in FGFR1 was also found in tumor tissue, representing a second hit on the RAS/MAPK pathway. These findings indicate that RAS/MAPK cascade overactivation can cause mosaic overgrowth phenotypes resembling PIK3CA-related overgrowth disorders (PROS) with cancer predisposition and are consistent with the hypothesis that RAS/MAPK hyperactivation can be involved in the pathogenesis of astrocytoma. This observation raises the issue of cancer predisposition in patients with RAS/MAPK pathway gene variants and expands genotype spectrum of LOs and the treatment options for similar cases through inhibition of the RAS/MAPK oversignaling.	2022	Lateralized overgrowth with vascular malformation caused by a somatic PTPN11 pathogenic variant: Another piece added to the puzzle of mosaic RASopathies.	35778969	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9966310	10.3390/vaccines11020396	The administration of mRNA-based tumour vaccines is considered a promising strategy in tumour immunotherapy, although its application against kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is still at its infancy stage. The purpose of this study was to identify potential antigens and to further select suitable patients for vaccination. Gene expression data and clinical information were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. GEPIA2 was used to evaluate the prognostic value of selected antigens. The relationship of antigens presenting cell infiltration with antigen expression was evaluated by TIMER, and immune subtypes were determined using unsupervised cluster analysis. Tumour antigens LRP2 and DOCK8, which are associated with prognosis and tumour-infiltrating antigen-presenting cells, were identified in KIRC. A total of six immune subtypes were identified, and patients with immune subtype 1-4 (IS1-4) tumours had an immune 'cold' phenotype, a higher tumour mutation burden, and poor survival. Moreover, these immune subtypes showed significant differences in the expression of immune checkpoint and immunogenic cell death modulators. Finally, the immune landscape of KIRC revealed the immune-related cell components in individual patients. This study suggests that LRP2 and DOCK8 are potential KIRC antigens in the development of mRNA vaccines, and patients with immune subtypes IS1-4 are suitable for vaccination.	2023	LRP2 and DOCK8 Are Potential Antigens for mRNA Vaccine Development in Immunologically 'Cold' KIRC Tumours.	36851274	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9540858	10.1002/humu.24423	Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) belongs to RASopathies, a group of syndromes caused by germline mutations in Ras/MAPK pathway genes. Most NF1 patients exhibit single inactivating pathogenic variants within the NF1 gene. We performed extensive genetic analyses in two NF1 families disclosing the first two cases of double de novo monoallelic NF1 variants. Both index patients described in this study had classical NF1. Probands were born from fathers in their late 30s and presented closely spaced double mutations (<100 bp) in NF1 regions showing an excess of somatic mutations. Closely spaced multiple mutations have been reported in RAS/MAPK signaling genes but never in NF1. Mutagenesis is a quasi-random process in humans, therefore two causative variants in the same gene, moreover in the same allele are exceptional. Here, we discuss possible mechanisms for this ultrarare event. Our findings confirm the possibility of a higher risk of concurrent de novo variants in NF1.	2022	Clinical presentation and genetic analyses of neurofibromatosis type 1 in independent patients with monoallelic double de novo closely spaced mutations in the NF1 gene.	35723633	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9295664	10.1136/bmjpo-2021-001385	<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the UK and Dutch referral criteria for short stature to determine their sensitivity and specificity in predicting pathological short stature. Adherence to the recommended panel of investigations was also assessed.<h4>Study design</h4>Retrospective review of medical records to examine the auxological parameters, investigations and diagnosis of subjects referred to two paediatric endocrine clinics at the Royal London Children's Hospital between 2016 and 2021. We analysed: height SD score (HtSDS), height SDS minus target height SDS (Ht-THSDS) and height deflection SDS (HtDefSDS). The UK referral criteria were HtSDS <-2.7, Ht-THSDS >2.0 and HtDefSDS >1.3. The Dutch referral criteria were HtSDS <-2.0, Ht-THSDS >1.6 and HtDefSDS >1.0.<h4>Results</h4>Data were available for 143 subjects (72% males) with mean (range) age 8.7 years (0.5-19.9). HtSDS and Ht-THSDS were significantly lower in the pathological stature (n=66) versus the non-pathological stature (n=77) subjects (-2.67±0.82 vs -1.97±0.70; p<0.001 and -2.07±1.02 vs -1.06±0.99; p<0.001, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity to detect pathology was 41% and 83% for the UK criteria (HtSDS <-2.7) compared with 59% and 79% for the Dutch criteria (HtSDS <-2.0), 48% and 83% for UK criteria (Ht-THSDS <-2.0) compared with 74% and 72% for Dutch criteria (Ht-THSDS <-1.6) and 33% and 68% for UK criteria (HtDefSDS >1.3) compared with 44% and 63% for the Dutch criteria (HtDefSDS >1.0). On average, each patient had 88% of the recommended investigations, and 53% had all the recommended testing. New pathology was identified in 36% of subjects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In isolation, the UK auxological referral thresholds have limited sensitivity and specificity for pathological short stature. The combination of HtSDS and Ht-THSDS improved the sensitivity of UK criteria to detect pathology from 41% to 68%. Attention to the child's genetic height potential prior to referral can prevent unnecessary assessments.	2022	Evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of the UK and Dutch growth referral criteria in predicting the diagnosis of pathological short stature.	36053660	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC8803135	10.3389/fcell.2021.736649	Recent studies have reported that T-cell differentiation protein 2 (MAL2) is an important regulator in cancers. Here, we downloaded data from multiple databases to analyze MAL2 expression and function in pan-cancers, especially in ovarian cancer (OC). Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases was used to examine MAL2 expression in 13 types of cancer. Kaplan-Meier plotter database was used to analyze the overall survival rate of MAL2 in pan-cancers. The Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), cBioPortal, and UCSC databases were used to examine MAL2 mutation in human cancers. Metascape, STRING, and GeneMANIA websites were used to explore MAL2 function in OC. Furthermore, ggplot2 package and ROC package were performed to analyze hub gene expression and undertake receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Drug sensitivity of MAL2 in OC was examined by the GSCALite database. In order to verify the results from databases above, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were conducted to detect the expression of MAL2 in OC cells. CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to knockout the MAL2 gene in the OC cell lines HO8910 and OVCAR3, using specific guide RNA targeting the exons of MAL2. Then, we performed proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion assays to investigate the impact of MAL2 in OC cell lines <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated biomarkers were significantly altered <i>in vitro</i> via western blotting and qRT-PCR. Taken together, we observed that MAL2 was remarkably dysregulated in multiple cancers and was related to patient overall survival (OS), mutation, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, experimental results showed that MAL2 deletion negatively regulated the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of OC, indicating that MAL2 is a novel oncogene that can activate EMT, significantly promote both the proliferation and migration of OC <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and provide new clues for treatment strategies.	2021	Multi-Omics Analysis of the Therapeutic Value of MAL2 Based on Data Mining in Human Cancers.	35111745	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC8349485	10.1186/s12885-021-08629-3	<h4>Background</h4>The tumor microenvironment (TME) has significantly correlation with tumor occurrence and prognosis. Our study aimed to identify the prognostic immune-related genes (IRGs)in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer (CRC).<h4>Methods</h4>Transcriptome and clinical data of CRC cases were downloaded from TCGA and GEO databases. Stromal score, immune score, and tumor purity were calculated by the ESTIMATE algorithm. Based on the scores, we divided CRC patients from the TCGA database into low and high groups, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Immune-related genes (IRGs) were selected by venn plots. To explore underlying pathways, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and functional enrichment analysis were used. After utilizing LASSO Cox regression analysis, we finally established a multi-IRGs signature for predicting the prognosis of CRC patients. A nomogram consists of the thirteen-IRGs signature and clinical parameters was developed to predict the overall survival (OS). We investigated the association between prognostic validated IRGs and immune infiltrates by TIMER database.<h4>Results</h4>Gene expression profiles and clinical information of 1635 CRC patients were collected from the TCGA and GEO databases. Higher stromal score, immune score and lower tumor purity were observed positive correlation with tumor stage and poor OS. Based on stromal score, immune score and tumor purity, 1517 DEGs, 1296 DEGs, and 1892 DEGs were identified respectively. The 948 IRGs were screened by venn plots. A thirteen-IRGs signature was constructed for predicting survival of CRC patients. Nomogram with a C-index of 0.769 (95%CI, 0.717-0.821) was developed to predict survival of CRC patients by integrating clinical parameters and thirteen-IRGs signature. The AUC for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS were 0.789, 0.783 and 0.790, respectively. Results from TIMER database revealed that CD1B, GPX3 and IDO1 were significantly related with immune infiltrates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, we established a novel thirteen immune-related genes signature that may serve as a validated prognostic predictor for CRC patients, thus will be conducive to individualized treatment decisions.	2021	Identification of prognostic immune-related gene signature associated with tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer.	34364366	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9482394	10.1002/mgg3.2012	<h4>Background</h4>The AHNAK2 gene encodes a large nucleoprotein expressed in several tissues, including brain, squamous epithelia, smooth muscle, and neuropil. Its role in calcium signaling has been suggested and to date, clear evidence about its involvement in the pathogenesis of clinical disorders is still lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>Here, we report a female 24-year-old patient diagnosed with a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like phenotype (CFC-like), characterized by epilepsy, psychomotor development delay, atopic dermatitis, congenital heart disease, hypotonia, and facial dysmorphism, who is compound heterozygote for two missense mutations in the AHNAK2 gene detected by exome sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>This patient had no detectable variant in any of the genes known to be associated with the cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome. Moreover, the mode of inheritance does not appear to be autosomal dominant, as it is in typical CFC syndrome. We have performed in silico assessment of mutation severity separately for each missense mutation, but this analysis excludes a severe effect on protein function. Protein structure predictions indicate the mutations are located in flexible regions possibly involved in molecular interactions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We discuss an alternative interpretation on the potential involvement of the two missense mutations in the AHNAK2 gene on the expression of CFC-like phenotype in this patient based on inter-allelic complementation.	2022	Exome sequencing in a child with neurodevelopmental disorder and epilepsy: Variant analysis of the AHNAK2 gene.	35789128	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
NA	10.4149/neo_2018_180907n679	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides with poor protein-coding capacity and key functions in regulation of gene expression. Dysregulations of lncRNAs (e.g. HOTAIR and MALAT I) were detected in plasma of breast cancer (BC) patients. Plasma samples are examined as liquid biopsies for purposes of non-invasive diagnostics therefore the research of plasma lncRNAs as potential plasma biomarkers became highly topical. 84 lncRNAs were profiled in 18 plasma samples - 9 BC patients and 9 age-matched healthy - using Human Inflammatory Response & Autoimmunity RT2 lncRNA PCR Array. Total RNA from plasma samples was isolated using miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit. Although a pre-amplification recommended for quantification from small starting RNA amounts was used, only 3 lncRNAs (A2ML1-AS1, GAS5 and SNHG5) were detected in all plasma samples. A total of 72 lncRNAs (e.g. HOTAIR or MALAT I) were detected only in some samples and 9 lncRNAs were not detected in any samples. No significant differences were observed in levels of plasma lncRNAs between the BC patients and healthy controls despite the fact that our panel contained also the lncRNAs whose levels were previously reported as significantly different in plasma or cancer tissues (e.g. GAS5, HOTAIR, MALAT I) in BC patients. Detection of lncRNAs in plasma is due to their low concentrations quite difficult as compared with tissues. Our findings suggest that analysis of plasma lncRNAs using this technology is not suitable for use as non-invasive diagnostic tool in BC patients.	2019	The use of Human Inflammatory Response and Autoimmunity RT2 lncRNA PCR Array for plasma examination in breast cancer patients prior to therapy.	30943749	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC7950244	10.18632/aging.202479	In this study, we used the ESTIMATE algorithm to analyze clinical data and transcriptome profiles of 1635 colorectal cancer (CRC) samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases and identify prognostic immune-related genes (IRGs). We identified 941 differentially expressed (4 downregulated and 937 upregulated) genes by comparing samples with high and low immune, stromal scores and tumor purity. LASSO Cox regression analyses showed that the risk score based on a ten-IRG signature was an independent prognostic factor in CRC. The nomogram with pathological stages (TNM) and the ten-IRG signature showed a C-index of 0.769 (95% CI, 0.717-0.821), and area under ROC curve values of 0.788, 0.782 and 0.789 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS, respectively. TIMER database analysis showed positive correlation between the ten prognostic IRGs and the levels of tumor-infiltrated immune cells, including CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. These findings demonstrate that this novel ten-IRG signature correlates with the pathological stages and the levels of multiple tumor-infiltrated immune cell types. This makes the ten-IRG signature a potential prognostic factor for CRC patients.	2021	Comprehensive analysis of prognostic immune-related genes in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer.	33536348	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9247466	10.3389/fgene.2022.909012	Climate change is a major influencing factor in beef production. The greenhouse gases produced from livestock production systems contribute to the overall greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this study was to identify selection signatures within and between Nguni and Bonsmara cattle in relation to production and adaptation. For this purpose, genomic 150 K single nucleotide polymorphism data from Nguni (<i>n</i> = 231) and Bonsmara (<i>n</i> = 252) cattle in South Africa were used. Extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) based analysis was executed within each population using integrated haplotype score (iHS). The R package rehh was used for detecting selection signatures across the two populations with cross population EHH (XP-EHH). Total of 121 regions of selection signatures were detected (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) in the Bonsmara and Nguni populations. Several genes relating to DNA methylation, heat stress, feed efficiency and nitrogen metabolism were detected within and between each population. These regions also included QTLs associated with residual feed intake, residual gain, carcass weight, stature and body weight in the Bonsmara, while QTLs associated with conception rate, shear force, tenderness score, juiciness, temperament, heat tolerance, feed efficiency and age at puberty were identified in Nguni. Based on the results of the study it is recommended that the Nguni and Bonsmara be utilized in crossbreeding programs as they have beneficial traits that may allow them to perform better in the presence of climate change. Results of this study coincide with Nguni and Bonsmara breed characteristics and performance, and furthermore support informative crossbreeding programs to enhance livestock productivity in South Africa.	2022	Selection Signatures in South African Nguni and Bonsmara Cattle Populations Reveal Genes Relating to Environmental Adaptation.	35783284	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

Missense pathogenetic variants of SOS1 gene are the second most common cause of Noonan syndrome (NS) and account approximately for 13% to 17% of cases. Subjects carrying a pathogenetic variant in SOS1 gene tend to exhibit a distinctive phenotype that is characterized by ectodermal abnormalities. Cutis verticis gyrata (CVG) is a rare disease, congenital or acquired, characterized by the redundancy of skin on scalp, forming thick skin folds and grooves of similar aspect to cerebral cortex gyri. Several references in the literature have reported association between nonessential primary form of CVG and NS.<h4>Case presentation</h4>we report two cases of newborns with CVG and phenotype suggestive for NS who have been diagnosed to harbour the same pathogenetic variant in SOS1 gene.<h4>Conclusions</h4>previously described patients with NS presenting CVG had received only clinical diagnosis.

Community lectures and individual genetic counseling were provided as intervention. Knowledge, beliefs, and health care-seeking behavior pertaining to otitis media were assessed pre- and post-genetic counseling. Twenty-five heads of households were interviewed. Beliefs regarding etiology of ear discharge varied widely, with swimming in the sea as the most commonly cited cause of ear discharge. During the post-counseling session, poor personal hygiene, dirty environment, and familial inheritance were mentioned as risk factors for otitis media or ear discharge. Knowledge about the genotypes for the A2ML1 variant and otitis media diagnoses within the household influenced beliefs on the role of hygiene and genetic susceptibility to otitis media and attitudes towards health care-seeking behavior. Genetic counseling was associated with variable improvement in knowledge on otitis media and in their understanding of genetic susceptibility to otitis media due to the A2ML1 variant. Language barriers, literacy level, cultural factors, and the complex nature of genetic information made genetic counseling in the particular population a challenge. Insights drawn from this experience recommend follow-up visits in the community.	2019	Genetic counseling in an indigenous Filipino community with a high prevalence of A2ML1-related otitis media.	29949068	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC9724055	10.4274/jcrpe.galenos.2022.2022-12-13	<h4>Objective</h4>Cardiac involvement is common in Noonan syndrome (NS). Concerns have been raised regarding the effect of recombinant growth hormone (rGH) use on ventricular wall thickness and a possible increased risk of cardiac side effects. This study aimed to investigate the effect of rGH on the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other cardiac findings in NS.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients under the age of 18 years and diagnosed with NS according to the Van der Burgt criteria, were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to those receiving rGH or not at the time of obtaining cardiac measurements. Before and after the treatment, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic (ECHO) assessments were made, including interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular internal diameter, and left ventricular posterior thickness. Results were expressed as Z scores.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-four NS subjects (16 boys, eight girls) were included. At the beginning of the follow up, the overall height standard deviation score was -2.56±0.94. Sixteen were on rGH. The mean rGH treatment duration was 8.3±3.8 years, and the mean dose was 0.22±0.04 mg/kg/week. The final height was 169±8.2 cm, and 10 of 11 patients who reached the final height received rGH. There was no difference between the rGH and non-rGH groups in terms of ECHO parameters pre-and post-treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this cohort, there was no change in ECHO parameters on rGH and during follow-up. These results suggest that rGH is safe in NS patients with cardiac pathology under close follow-up.	2022	The Effect of Growth Hormone Therapy on Cardiac Outcomes in Noonan Syndrome: Long Term Follow-up Results	35859537	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

The proband carried a c.371A>G mutation in exon 3 of <i>PPP1CB</i>, which is a missense mutation. This was a <i>de novo</i> mutation as the parents of the proband showed no mutation at this site.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this study, we identified a novel mutation of <i>PPP1CB</i>, which enriched the mutation spectrum of the <i>PPP1CB</i> gene and provided a basis for the diagnosis of NSLH2.	2022	Case report: Identification and clinical phenotypic analysis of novel mutation of the <i>PPP1CB</i> gene in NSLH2 syndrome.	36160684	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC8301621	10.1371/journal.pone.0255311	Essential hypertension is a common cardiovascular disease with complex etiology, closely related to genetic and environmental factors. The pathogenesis of hypertension involves alteration in vascular resistance caused by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and renin angiotensin system (RAS). Susceptibility factors of hypertension vary with regions and ethnicities. In this study, we conducted target capture sequencing on 54 genes related to SNS and RAS derived from a collection of Han nationality, consisting of 151 hypertension patients and 65 normal subjects in Xinjiang, China. Six non-synonymous mutations related to hypertension were identified, including GRK4 rs1644731 and RDH8 rs1801058, Mutations are predicted to affect 3D conformation, force field, transmembrane domain and RNA secondary structure of corresponding genes. Based on protein interaction network and pathway enrichment, GRK4 is predicted to participate in hypertension by acting on dopaminergic synapse, together with interacting components. RDH8 is involved in vitamin A (retinol) metabolism and consequent biological processes related to hypertension. Thus, GRK4 and RDH8 may serve as susceptibility genes for hypertension. This finding provides new genetic evidence for elucidating risk factors of hypertension in Han nationality in Xinjiang, which in turn, enriches genetic resource bank of hypertension susceptibility genes.	2021	Targeted capture sequencing identifies genetic variations of GRK4 and RDH8 in Han Chinese with essential hypertension in Xinjiang.	34297769	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

The purpose of this study was to explore the expression profile, potential functions, and diagnostic and clinical significance of lncRNAs in sinonasal inverted papilloma (SNIP). The expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs were analyzed using a microarray. The potential functions and clinical implications of specific lncRNAs were further analyzed by bioinformatics and statistical methods. Microarray analysis identified 1,668 significantly upregulated and 1,767 downregulated lncRNAs in SNIP. Several mRNAs coexpressed with lncRNAs were enriched in some biological processes and cellular signaling pathways related to tumorigenesis. Lnc-AKTIP might interact with a variety of tumor-associated proteins and transcription factors, such as PCBP2, IRF-1, and p53. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for lnc-AKTIP showed an area under the curve of 0.939. Notably, its expression level was significantly decreased in SNIP tissues versus normal tissues and was associated with SNIP staging. Lnc-AKTIP may serve as a valuable diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for SNIP.	2022	Comprehensive Analysis of Sinonasal Inverted Papilloma Expression Profiles Identifies Long Non-Coding RNA AKTIP as a Potential Biomarker.	35186045	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC6650032	10.1371/journal.pone.0216144	The present study, for the first time, reported twelve A2M isoforms in Tenualosa ilisha, through SMRT sequencing. Hilsa shad, T. ilisha, an anadromous fish, faces environmental stresses and is thus prone to diseases. Here, expression profiles of different A2M isoforms in four tissues were studied in T. ilisha, for the tissue specific diversity of A2M. Large scale high quality full length transcripts (>0.99% accuracy) were obtained from liver, ovary, testes and gill transcriptomes, through Iso-sequencing on PacBio RSII. A total of 12 isoforms, with complete putatative proteins, were detected in three tissues (7 isoforms in liver, 4 in ovary and 1 in testes). Complete structure of A2M mRNA was predicted from these isoforms, containing 4680 bp sequence, 35 exons and 1508 amino acids. With Homo sapiens A2M as reference, six functional domains (A2M_N,A2M_N2, A2M, Thiol-ester_cl, Complement and Receptor domain), along with a bait region, were predicted in A2M consensus protein. A total of 35 splice sites were identified in T. ilisha A2M consensus transcript, with highest frequency (55.7%) of GT-AG splice sites, as compared to that of Homo sapiens. Liver showed longest isoform (X1) consisting of all domains, while smallest (X10) was found in ovary with one Receptor domain. Present study predicted five putative markers (I-212, I-269, A-472, S-567 and Y-906) for EUS disease resistance in A2M protein, which were present in MG2 domains (A2M_N and A2M_N2), by comparing with that of resistant and susceptible/unknown response species. These markers classified fishes into two groups, resistant and susceptible response. Potential markers, predicted in T. ilisha, placed it to be EUS susceptible category. Putative markers reported in A2M protein may serve as molecular markers in diagnosis of EUS disease resistance/susceptibility in fishes and may have a potential for inclusion in the marker panel for pilot studies. Further, challenging studies are required to confirm the role of particular A2M isoforms and markers identified in immune protection against EUS disease.	2019	Tissue specific alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M) splice isoform diversity in Hilsa shad, Tenualosa ilisha (Hamilton, 1822).	31335900	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

With a focus on Han Chinese families with CD, the aim of this study was to find genetic variations that increase CD susceptibility by genome sequencing, genetic association, expression, and functional research. <b>Materials and methods:</b> We performed family-based genome sequencing (WGS) analysis on 24 patients with CD from 12 families and then filtered shared potential causal variants by incorporating association results from meta-analyses of CD GWAS and immunology genes and <i>in silico</i> variant effect prediction algorithms. Replication analyses were performed in an independent cohort including 381 patients with CD and 381 control subjects. <b>Results:</b> There were 92 genetic variants significantly associated with CD in Chinese individuals. Among them, 61 candidate loci were validated in replication analyses. As a result, patients carrying a rare frameshift variant (c.1143_1144insG; p. Leu381_Leu382fs) in gene <i>SIRPB1</i> had significantly higher risk to develop CD (<i>p</i> = 0.03, OR 4.59, 95% CI 0.98-21.36, 81.82% vs. 49.53%). The frameshift variation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, Akt, and Jak2, elevated the expression of <i>SIRPB1</i> at the mRNA and protein levels, activated DAP12, and controlled the activation of NF-κB in macrophages. Additionally, it promoted the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, TNF-, and IL-6. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results suggest that the rare gain-of-function frameshift variant in <i>SIRPB1</i> is associated in Han Chinese patients with CD. The functional mechanism of <i>SIRPB1</i> and its downstream inflammatory pathways was preliminarily explored in CD.	2023	A frameshift variant in the <i>SIRPB1</i> gene confers susceptibility to Crohn's disease in a Chinese population.	37323681	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC5799236	10.1038/s41598-018-20894-0	RASopathies are a group of heterogeneous conditions caused by germline mutations in RAS/MAPK signalling pathway genes. With next-generation sequencing (NGS), sequencing capacity is no longer a limitation to molecular diagnosis. Instead, the rising number of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) poses challenges to clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We investigated the potential of an integrated pipeline combining NGS and the functional assessment of variants for the diagnosis of RASopathies. We included 63 Chinese patients with RASopathies that had previously tested negative for PTPN11 and HRAS mutations. In these patients, we performed a genetic analysis of genes associated with RASopathies using a multigene NGS panel and Sanger sequencing. For the VUSs, we evaluated evidence from genetic, bioinformatic and functional data. Twenty disease-causing mutations were identified in the 63 patients, providing a primary diagnostic yield of 31.7%. Four VUSs were identified in five patients. The functional assessment supported the pathogenicity of the RAF1 and RIT1 VUSs, while the significance of two VUSs in A2ML1 remained unclear. In summary, functional analysis improved the diagnostic yield from 31.7% to 36.5%. Although technically demanding and time-consuming, a functional genetic diagnostic analysis can ease the clinical translation of these findings to aid bedside interpretation.	2018	Integrating Functional Analysis in the Next-Generation Sequencing Diagnostic Pipeline of RASopathies.	29402968	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol
PMC7563526	10.3390/jcm9092845	Otitis media (OM) is one of the most common diseases occurring during childhood. Microbiological investigations concerning this topic have been primarily focused on the four classical otopathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) mainly because most of the studies have been conducted with culture-dependent methods. In recent years, the introduction of culture-independent techniques has allowed high-throughput investigation of entire bacterial communities, leading to a better comprehension of the role of resident flora in health and disease. The upper respiratory tract (URT) is a region of major interest in otitis media pathogenesis, as it could serve as a source of pathogens for the middle ear (ME). Studies conducted with culture-independent methods in the URT and ME have provided novel insights on the pathogenesis of middle ear diseases through the identification of both possible new causative agents and of potential protective bacteria, showing that imbalances in bacterial communities could influence the natural history of otitis media in children. The aim of this review is to examine available evidence in microbiome research and otitis media in the pediatric age, with a focus on its different phenotypes: acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion and chronic suppurative otitis media.	2020	Upper Respiratory Tract Microbiome and Otitis Media Intertalk: Lessons from the Literature. 	32887458	A2ML1	CPAMD9	primary_symbol

GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were performed to annotate the function of differentially expressed mRNAs. The real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was admitted to verify their expression. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network, cis-acting element, trans-acting element and transcription factor (TF) regulation analysis were constructed to predict the potential molecular regulatory ﻿mechanisms and targets for LHB tendinitis.<h4>Results</h4>103 differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs, of which 75 were up-regulated and 28 were down-regulated, were detected to be differentially expressed in LHBT. The expressions of 4 most differentially expressed lncRNAs (A2MP1, LOC100996671, COL6A4P, lnc-LRCH1-5) were confirmed by qRT-PCR. GO functional analysis indicated that related lncRNAs and mRNAs were involved in the biological processes of regulation of innate immune response, neutrophil chemotaxis, interleukin-1 cell response and others. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that related lncRNAs and mRNAs were involved in MAPK signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway and others. TF regulation analysis revealed that COL6A4P2, A2MP1 and LOC100996671 target NFKB2.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LlncRNA-COL6A4P2, A2MP1 and LOC100996671 may regulate the inflammation of LHBT in RCT patients through NFKB2/NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and preliminarily revealed the pathological molecular mechanism of tendinitis of LHBT.	2022	mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of rotator cuff tear patients reveal inflammatory features in long head of biceps tendon.	35725478	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol
NA	10.1111/liv.14916	<h4>Background and aims</h4>In the CENTRAL trial context, we found diverse liver fat dynamics in response to different dietary interventions. Epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to the intraindividual variation. Moreover, genetic factors are involved in developing nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD), a disease reflected by an increase in intrahepatic fat (IHF). In this exploratory analysis, we primarily aimed to examine the effect of lifestyle interventions on DNA-methylation of NAFLD related genes associated with IHF.<h4>Methods</h4>For 120 participants from the CENTRAL trial, an 18-month regimen of either low-fat (LF) or Mediterranean-low carbohydrate (MED/LC) diets, with or without physical activity (PA+/PA-), was instructed. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure IHF%, which was analysed for association with CpG specific DNA-methylation levels of 41 selected candidate genes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms known to be associated with NAFLD within the studied genes were genotyped by TaqMan assays.<h4>Results</h4>At baseline, participants (92% men; body mass index = 30.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) had mean IHF of 10.7% (59% NAFLD). Baseline-IHF% was inversely correlated with DNA-methylation at individual CpGs within AC074286.1, CRACR2A, A2MP1, FARP1 (P < .05 for all multivariate models). FARP1 rs9584805 showed association with IHF, with the prevalence of NAFLD and baseline methylation level of the CpG site (cg00071727) associated with IHF%. Following 18-month lifestyle intervention, differential DNA-methylation patterns were observed between diets at cg14335324 annotated to A2MP1 (P = .04, LF vs. MED/LC), and differential DNA-methylation between PA groups within AC074286.1, CRACR2A, and FARP1 CpGs (P < .05 for all, PA-vs. PA+).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study suggests epigenetic markers for IHF and potential epigenetic remodeling after long-term lifestyle interventions.	2021	Effects of lifestyle interventions on epigenetic signatures of liver fat: Central randomized controlled trial.	33938135	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol

It is applicable to any genome set, even with the number of genomes exceeding 100, and efficiently implemented using fast computer software. Only 50 evolutionary recent human pseudogenes were predicted. Their functional homologs in model species are often associated with the immune system or digestion and mainly express in the testes. According to current evidence, knockout of most of these genes leads to an abnormal phenotype.

PMC9589178	10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11119	The global incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is mounting incessantly, and it is emerging as the most frequent cause of chronic and end stage liver disorders. It is the starting point for a range of conditions from simple steatosis to more progressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dysregulation of insulin secretion and dyslipidemia due to obesity and other lifestyle variables are the primary contributors to establishment of NAFLD. Onset and progression of NAFLD is orchestrated by an interplay of metabolic environment with genetic and epigenetic factors. An incompletely understood mechanism of NAFLD progression has greatly hampered the progress in identification of novel prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence suggests altered DNA methylation pattern as a key determinant of NAFLD pathogenesis. Environmental and lifestyle factors can manipulate DNA methylation patterns in a reversible manner, which manifests as changes in gene expression. In this review we attempt to highlight the importance of DNA methylation in establishment and progression of NAFLD. Development of novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies centered around DNA methylation signatures and modifiers has also been explored.	2022	Deciphering the role of aberrant DNA methylation in NAFLD and NASH.	36299516	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol
PMC9690481	10.3390/genes13112142	Currently, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a leading global cause of chronic liver disease, and is expected to become one of the most common indications of liver transplantation. MAFLD is associated with obesity, involving multiple mechanisms such as alterations in lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, hyperinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and extracellular matrix formation. However, the onset and progression of MAFLD is variable among individuals, being influenced by intrinsic (personal) and external environmental factors. In this context, sequence structural variants across the human genome, epigenetic phenomena (i.e., DNA methylation, histone modifications, and long non-coding RNAs) affecting gene expression, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and metabolomics/lipidomic fingerprints may account for differences in MAFLD outcomes through interactions with nutritional features. This knowledge may contribute to gaining a deeper understanding of the molecular and physiological processes underlying MAFLD pathogenesis and phenotype heterogeneity, as well as facilitating the identification of biomarkers of disease progression and therapeutic targets for the implementation of tailored nutritional strategies. This comprehensive literature review highlights the potential of nutrigenetic, nutriepigenetic, nutrimetagenomic, nutritranscriptomics, and nutrimetabolomic approaches for the prevention and management of MAFLD in humans through the lens of precision nutrition.	2022	Multi-Omics Nutritional Approaches Targeting Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease.	36421817	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol
PMC8787199	10.3389/fmed.2021.770504	Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis accompanied by one of three features: overweight or obesity, T2DM, or lean or normal weight with evidence of metabolic dysregulation. It is distinguished by excessive fat accumulation in hepatocytes, and a decrease in the liver's ability to oxidize fats, the accumulation of ectopic fat, and the activation of proinflammatory pathways. Chronic damage will keep this pathophysiologic cycle active causing progression from hepatic steatosis to cirrhosis and eventually, hepatocarcinoma. Epigenetics affecting gene expression without altering DNA sequence allows us to study MAFLD pathophysiology from a different perspective, in which DNA methylation processes, histone modifications, and miRNAs expression have been closely associated with MAFLD progression. However, these considerations also faced us with the circumstance that modifying those epigenetics patterns might lead to MAFLD regression. Currently, epigenetics is an area of great interest because it could provide new insights in therapeutic targets and non-invasive biomarkers. This review comprises an update on the role of epigenetic patterns, as well as innovative therapeutic targets and biomarkers in MAFLD.	2021	An Update in Epigenetics in Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease.	35087844	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol

Although several environmental risk factors for respiratory symptoms are known, knowledge on genetic risk factors is lacking. We aim to identify genetic variants associated with respiratory symptoms by genome-wide association (GWA) analyses.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted the first GWA study on cough, dyspnea and phlegm among 7,976 participants in the LifeLines I cohort and used the LifeLines II cohort (n = 5,260) and the Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen cohort (n = 1,529) for replication.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 50 SNPs that were assessed for replication. Rs16918212, located in the alpha-2-macroglobulin pseudogene 1 (A2MP1), was associated with cough in both the identification (odds ratio (OR) = 0.72, p = 5.41 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and the meta-analyzed replication cohorts (OR = 0.83, p = 0.033). No other significant replicated associations were found.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Given that only 1 out of 50 SNPs showed significant replication (i.e. 2%) we conclude that we did not find a convincing association between genetic markers and respiratory symptoms. Since, environmental exposures are important risk factors for respiratory symptoms, the next step is to perform a genome-wide interaction (GWI) study to identify genetic susceptibility loci for respiratory symptoms in interaction with known harmful environmental exposures.	2017	No convincing association between genetic markers and respiratory symptoms: results of a GWA study.	28073367	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol
PMC8949112	10.3390/jpm12030412	Age at depressive onset (AAO) corresponds to unique symptomatology and clinical outcomes. Integration of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results with additional “omic” measures to evaluate AAO has not been reported and may reveal novel markers of susceptibility and/or resistance to major depressive disorder (MDD). To address this gap, we integrated genomics with metabolomics using data-driven network analysis to characterize and differentiate MDD based on AAO. This study first performed two GWAS for AAO as a continuous trait in (a) 486 adults from the Pharmacogenomic Research Network-Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS), and (b) 295 adults from the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes (CO-MED) study. Variants from top signals were integrated with 153 p180-assayed metabolites to establish multi-omics network characterizations of early (<age 18) and adult-onset depression. The most significant variant (p = 8.77 × 10−8) localized to an intron of SAMD3. In silico functional annotation of top signals (p < 1 × 10−5) demonstrated gene expression enrichment in the brain and during embryonic development. Network analysis identified differential associations between four variants (in/near INTU, FAT1, CNTN6, and TM9SF2) and plasma metabolites (phosphatidylcholines, carnitines, biogenic amines, and amino acids) in early- compared with adult-onset MDD. Multi-omics integration identified differential biosignatures of early- and adult-onset MDD. These biosignatures call for future studies to follow participants from childhood through adulthood and collect repeated -omics and neuroimaging measures to validate and deeply characterize the biomarkers of susceptibility and/or resistance to MDD development.	2022	Multi-Omics Characterization of Early- and Adult-Onset Major Depressive Disorder.	35330412	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol
PMC8627656	10.7717/peerj.12536	As an innate feature of human beings, gender differences have an influence on various biological phenotypes, yet it does not attract enough attention in genomics studies. The prognosis of multiple carcinomas usually exhibits a favorable ending for female patients, but the neglect of gender differences can cause serious bias in survival analysis. Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are mostly downstream of androgens or estrogen. The present study was aimed to screen eRNAs in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. The findings revealed that eRNA TBX5-AS1 was expressed differently between female and male patients. Meanwhile, its prognostic significance appeared only in male patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) type. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis proved that the expression level of TBX5-AS1 increased following the activation of the androgen signaling pathway. In pan-cancer analysis, the prognostic prediction based on gender grouping obtained more meaningful results, and the synergy between TBX5-AS1 and its homologous target was more consistent. Furthermore, immunity variations between sexes prompted us to explore the role that TBX5-AS1 played in tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy. The robust evidence proved that male patients with high expression of TBX5-AS1 possessed a malignant immune microenvironment and urgently needed immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. In conclusion, TBX5-AS1 may be one of the strongest candidates to predict prognosis for male patients with SCC and provide a reference for immunotherapy.	2021	Gender specific eRNA TBX5-AS1 as the immunological biomarker for male patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma in pan-cancer screening.	34900441	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol
PMC8554120	10.3389/fgene.2021.716558	Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, is a complex disease. The risk of developing active TB is in part determined by host genetic factors. Most genetic studies investigating TB susceptibility fail to replicate association signals particularly across diverse populations. South African populations arose because of multi-wave genetic admixture from the indigenous KhoeSan, Bantu-speaking Africans, Europeans, Southeast Asian-and East Asian populations. This has led to complex genetic admixture with heterogenous patterns of linkage disequilibrium and associated traits. As a result, precise estimation of both global and local ancestry is required to prevent both false positive and false-negative associations. Here, 820 individuals from South Africa were genotyped on the SNP-dense Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (∼1.7M SNPs) followed by local and global ancestry inference using RFMix. Local ancestry adjusted allelic association (LAAA) models were utilized owing to the extensive genetic heterogeneity present in this population. Hence, an interaction term, comprising the identification of the minor allele that corresponds to the ancestry present at the specific locus under investigation, was included as a covariate. One SNP (rs28647531) located on chromosome 4q22 was significantly associated with TB susceptibility and displayed a SNP minor allelic effect (G allele, frequency = 0.204) whilst correcting for local ancestry for Bantu-speaking African ancestry (<i>p</i>-value = 5.518 × 10<sup>-7</sup>; OR = 3.065; SE = 0.224). Although no other variants passed the significant threshold, clear differences were observed between the lead variants identified for each ancestry. Furthermore, the LAAA model robustly captured the source of association signals in multi-way admixed individuals from South Africa and allowed the identification of ancestry-specific disease risk alleles associated with TB susceptibility that have previously been missed.	2021	Local Ancestry Adjusted Allelic Association Analysis Robustly Captures Tuberculosis Susceptibility Loci.	34721521	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol

This study used genome-wide genotypic and phenotypic data from the COPDGene study to identify genetic risk factors for depression.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were from 9716 COPDGene subjects with ≥10 pack-year history. Depression was defined as antidepressant use and/or a HADS depression subscale score ≥8. Non-Hispanic White (6576) and African-American (3140) subsets were analyzed. A GWAS pipeline identified SNPs associated with depression in each group. Network analysis software analyzed gene interactions through common biological pathways, genetic interactions, and tissue-specific gene expression.<h4>Results</h4>The mean age was 59.4 years (SD 9.0) with 46.5% female subjects. Depression was in 24.7% of the NHW group (1622) and 12.5% of the AA group (391). No SNPs had genome-wide significance. One of the top SNPs, rs12036147 (p = 1.28 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), is near CHRM3. Another SNP was near MDGA2 (rs17118176, p = 3.52 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Top genes formed networks for synaptic transmission with a statistically significant level of more co-expression in brain than other tissues, particularly in the basal ganglia (p = 1.00 × 10<sup>-4</sup>).<h4>Limitations</h4>Limitations included a depression definition based on antidepressant use and a limited HADS score subgroup, which could increase false negatives in depressed patients not on antidepressants. Antidepressants used for smoking cessation in non-depressed patients could lead to false positives.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Systems biology analysis identified statistically significant pathways whereby multiple genes influence depression. The gene set pathway analysis and COPDGene data can help investigate depression in future studies.	2019	GWAS and systems biology analysis of depressive symptoms among smokers from the COPDGene cohort.	30219690	A2MP1	A2MP	primary_symbol
PMC8569968	10.1186/s13578-021-00701-6	<h4>Background</h4>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a disorder that extends from simple hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is effectively alleviated by lifestyle intervention. Nevertheless, DNA methylation mechanism underling the effect of environmental factors on NAFLD and NASH is still obscure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exercise and diet intervention in NAFLD and NASH via DNA methylation of GAB2.<h4>Methods</h4>Methylation of genomic DNA in human NAFLD was quantified using Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip assay after exercise (Ex), low carbohydrate diet (LCD) and exercise plus low carbohydrate diet (ELCD) intervention. The output Idat files were processed using ChAMP package. False discovery rate on genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation (q < 0.05), and cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) which are located in promoters were used for subsequent analysis (|Δβ|≥ 0.1). K-means clustering was used to cluster differentially methylated genes according to 3D genome information from Human embryonic stem cell. To quantify DNA methylation and mRNA expression of GRB2 associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) in NASH mice after Ex, low fat diet (LFD) and exercise plus low fat diet (ELFD), MassARRAY EpiTYPER and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used.<h4>Results</h4>Both LCD and ELCD intervention on human NAFLD can induce same DNA methylation alterations at critical genes in blood, e.g., GAB2, which was also validated in liver and adipose of NASH mice after LFD and ELFD intervention. Moreover, methylation of CpG units (i.e., CpG_10.11.12) inversely correlated with mRNA expression GAB2 in adipose tissue of NASH mice after ELFD intervention.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We highlighted the susceptibility of DNA methylation in GAB2 to ELFD intervention, through which exercise and diet can protect against the progression of NAFLD and NASH on the genome level, and demonstrated that the DNA methylation variation in blood could mirror epigenetic signatures in target tissues of important biological function, i.e., liver and adipose tissue.

Recent advances have made these techniques practical and affordable for essentially any laboratory with experience in molecular biology. A variety of computational methods have been developed to decrease the amount of bioinformatics expertise necessary to analyze these data. Nevertheless, many barriers persist which discourage new labs from using functional genomics approaches. Since high-quality gene expression studies have enduring value as resources to the entire research community, it is of particular importance that small labs have the capacity to share their analyzed datasets with the research community. Here we introduce ExpressionDB, an open source platform for visualizing RNA-seq and microarray data accommodating virtually any number of different samples. ExpressionDB is based on Shiny, a customizable web application which allows data sharing locally and online with customizable code written in R. ExpressionDB allows intuitive searches based on gene symbols, descriptions, or gene ontology terms, and it includes tools for dynamically filtering results based on expression level, fold change, and false-discovery rates. Built-in visualization tools include heatmaps, volcano plots, and principal component analysis, ensuring streamlined and consistent visualization to all users. All of the scripts for building an ExpressionDB with user-supplied data are freely available on GitHub, and the Creative Commons license allows fully open customization by end-users.

PMC4009255	10.1155/2014/253128	The biomedical literature represents a rich source of biomarker information. However, both the size of literature databases and their lack of standardization hamper the automatic exploitation of the information contained in these resources. Text mining approaches have proven to be useful for the exploitation of information contained in the scientific publications. Here, we show that a knowledge-driven text mining approach can exploit a large literature database to extract a dataset of biomarkers related to diseases covering all therapeutic areas. Our methodology takes advantage of the annotation of MEDLINE publications pertaining to biomarkers with MeSH terms, narrowing the search to specific publications and, therefore, minimizing the false positive ratio. It is based on a dictionary-based named entity recognition system and a relation extraction module. The application of this methodology resulted in the identification of 131,012 disease-biomarker associations between 2,803 genes and 2,751 diseases, and represents a valuable knowledge base for those interested in disease-related biomarkers.

PMC9899164	10.1007/s12035-022-03124-7	Neuropathic pain is a common chronic condition, which remains poorly understood. Many patients receiving treatment continue to experience severe pain, due to limited diagnostic/treatment management programmes. The development of objective clinical diagnostic/treatment strategies requires identification of robust biomarkers of neuropathic pain. To this end, we looked to identify biomarkers of chronic neuropathic pain by assessing gene expression profiles in an animal model of neuropathic pain, and differential gene expression in patients to determine the potential translatability. We demonstrated cross-species validation of several genes including those identified through bioinformatic analysis by assessing their expression in blood samples from neuropathic pain patients, according to conservative assessments of significance measured using Bonferroni-corrected p-values. These include CASP5 (p = 0.00226), CASP8 (p = 0.00587), CASP9 (p = 2.09 × 10<sup>-9</sup>), FPR2 (p = 0.00278), SH3BGRL3 (p = 0.00633), and TMEM88 (p = 0.00038). A ROC analysis revealed several combinations of genes to show high levels of discriminatory power in the comparison of neuropathic pain patients and control participants, of which the combination SH3BGRL3, TMEM88, and CASP9 achieved the highest level (AUROC = 0.923). The CASP9 gene was found to be common in five combinations of three genes revealing the highest levels of discriminatory power. In contrast, the gene combination PLAC8, ROMO1, and A3GALT2 showed the highest levels of discriminatory power in the comparison of neuropathic pain and nociceptive pain (AUROC = 0.919), when patients were grouped by S-LANSS scores. Molecules that demonstrate an active role in neuropathic pain have the potential to be developed into a biological measure for objective diagnostic tests, or as novel drug targets for improved pain management.	2023	The Identification of Human Translational Biomarkers of Neuropathic Pain and Cross-Species Validation Using an Animal Model.	36422814	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

We include a theoretical introduction which facilitates the understanding of the paper for non-mathematicians, especially for biologists not familiar with the theory of Markov chains.	2022	Note on DNA Analysis and Redesigning Using Markov Chain. 	35328107	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC8478729	10.1007/s11248-021-00271-w	In this study, we investigated the effect of a triple knockout of the genes alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase (GGTA1), cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH), and alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase 2 (A3GALT2) in Yucatan miniature pigs on human immune reactivity. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to create pigs lacking GGTA1 (GTKO) and GGTA1/CMAH/A3GALT2 triple gene knockout (TKO). The expression of all three xenoantigens was absent in TKO pigs, but there was no additional reduction in the level of Galα1,3Gal (αGal) epitopes expression in the A3GALT2 gene KO. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), aorta endothelial cells (AECs), and cornea endothelial cells (CECs) were isolated from these pigs, and their ability to bind human IgM/IgG and their cytotoxicity in human sera were evaluated. Compared to wild type (WT) pigs, the level of human antibody binding of the PBMCs, AECs, and CECs of the transgenic pigs (GTKO and TKO) was significantly reduced. However, there were significant differences in human antibody binding between GTKO and TKO depending on the cell type. Human antibody binding of TKO pigs was less than that of GTKO on PBMCs but was similar between GTKO and TKO pigs for AECs and CECs. Cytotoxicity of transgenic pig (GTKO and TKO) PBMCs and AECs was significantly reduced compared to that of WT pigs. However, TKO pigs showed a reduction in cytotoxicity compared to GTKO pigs on PBMCs, whereas in AECs from both TKO and GTKO pigs, there was no difference. The cytotoxicity of transgenic pig CECs was significantly decreased from that of WT at 300 min, but there was no significant reduction in TKO pigs from GTKO. Our results indicate that genetic modification of donor pigs for xenotransplantation should be tailored to the target organ and silencing of additional genes such as CMAH or A3GALT2 based on GTKO might not be essential in Yucatan miniature pigs.	2021	Human immune reactivity of GGTA1/CMAH/A3GALT2 triple knockout Yucatan miniature pigs.	34232440	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC9853002	10.3389/fbioe.2022.1082290	Targeted antigen delivery allows activation of the immune system to kill cancer cells. Here we report the targeted delivery of various epitopes, including a peptide, a small molecule, and a sugar, to tumors by pH Low Insertion Peptides (pHLIPs), which respond to surface acidity and insert to span the membranes of metabolically activated cancer and immune cells within tumors. Epitopes linked to the extracellular ends of pH Low Insertion Peptide peptides were positioned at the surfaces of tumor cells and were recognized by corresponding anti-epitope antibodies. Special attention was devoted to the targeted delivery of the nine residue HA peptide epitope from the Flu virus hemagglutinin. The HA sequence is not present in the human genome, and immunity is readily developed during viral infection or immunization with KLH-HA supplemented with adjuvants. We tested and refined a series of double-headed HA-pHLIP agents, where two HA epitopes were linked to a single pH Low Insertion Peptide peptide <i>via</i> two Peg12 or Peg24 polymers, which enable HA epitopes to engage both antibody binding sites. HA-epitopes positioned at the surfaces of tumor cells remain exposed to the extracellular space for 24-48 h and are then internalized. Different vaccination schemes and various adjuvants, including analogs of FDA approved adjuvants, were tested in mice and resulted in a high titer of anti-HA antibodies. Anti-HA antibody binds HA-pHLIP in blood and travels as a complex leading to significant tumor targeting with no accumulation in organs and to hepatic clearance. HA-pHLIP agents induced regression of 4T1 triple negative breast tumor and B16F10 MHC-I negative melanoma tumors in immunized mice. The therapeutic efficacy potentially is limited by the drop of the level of anti-HA antibodies in the blood to background level after three injections of HA-pHLIP. We hypothesize that additional boosts would be required to keep a high titer of anti-HA antibodies to enhance efficacy. pH Low Insertion Peptide-targeted antigen therapy may provide an opportunity to treat tumors unresponsive to T cell based therapies, having a small number of neo-antigens, or deficient in MHC-I presentation at the surfaces of cancer cells either alone or in combination with other approaches.	2022	Tumor treatment by pHLIP-targeted antigen delivery.	36686229	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC9618879	10.3389/fcell.2022.1031812	The large animal model has gradually become an essential part of preclinical research studies, relating to exploring the disease pathological mechanism, genic function, pharmacy, and other subjects. Although the mouse model has already been widely accepted in clinical experiments, the need for finding an animal model with high similarity compared with a human model is urgent due to the different body functions and systems between mice and humans. The pig is an optimal choice for replacement. Therefore, enhancing the production of pigs used for models is an important part of the large animal model as well. Transgenic pigs show superiority in pig model creation because of the progress in genetic engineering. Successful cases of transgenic pig models occur in the clinical field of metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and genetic diseases. In addition, the choice of pig breed influences the effort and efficiency of reproduction, and the mini pig has relative obvious advantages in pig model production. Indeed, pig models in these diseases provide great value in studies of their causes and treatments, especially at the genetic level. This review briefly outlines the method used to create transgenic pigs and species of producing transgenic pigs and provides an overview of their applications on different diseases and limitations for present pig model developments.	2022	Application of the transgenic pig model in biomedical research: A review.	36325365	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC8063339	10.1186/s12711-021-00631-4	<h4>Background</h4>Short tandem repeats (STRs) are genetic markers with a greater mutation rate than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and are widely used in genetic studies and forensics. However, most studies in pigs have focused only on SNPs or on a limited number of STRs.<h4>Results</h4>This study screened 394 deep-sequenced genomes from 22 domesticated pig breeds/populations worldwide, wild boars from both Europe and Asia, and numerous outgroup Suidaes, and identified a set of 878,967 polymorphic STRs (pSTRs), which represents the largest repository of pSTRs in pigs to date. We found multiple lines of evidence that pSTRs in coding regions were affected by purifying selection. The enrichment of trinucleotide pSTRs in coding sequences (CDS), 5'UTR and H3K4me3 regions suggests that trinucleotide STRs serve as important components in the exons and promoters of the corresponding genes. We demonstrated that, compared to SNPs, pSTRs provide comparable or even greater accuracy in determining the breed identity of individuals. We identified pSTRs that showed significant population differentiation between domestic pigs and wild boars in Asia and Europe. We also observed that some pSTRs were significantly associated with environmental variables, such as average annual temperature or altitude of the originating sites of Chinese indigenous breeds, among which we identified loss-of-function and/or expanded STRs overlapping with genes such as AHR, LAS1L and PDK1. Finally, our results revealed that several pSTRs show stronger signals in domestic pig-wild boar differentiation or association with the analysed environmental variables than the flanking SNPs within a 100-kb window.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides a genome-wide high-density map of pSTRs in diverse pig populations based on genome sequencing data, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of their roles in evolutionary and environmental adaptation.	2021	A worldwide map of swine short tandem repeats and their associations with evolutionary and environmental adaptations.	33892623	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC9563607	10.1016/j.bbrep.2022.101359	In HNSCC, few studies have focused on the relationship between wild-type TP53 and mutant TP53-related immunity and prognosis. Our objective was to explore how TP53 mutation regulates the immunophenotype of HNSCC and thus affects the prognosis of HNSCC. Cox and Lasso regression were used to establish a prognostic model of TP53-related immune genes, on which basis a nomogram was used to establish a clinical prediction model, and ROC curves were further used to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. The risk of death in the TP53<sub>WT</sub> group was only 0.68 times that in the TP53<sub>Mut</sub> group (HR = 0.68, CI: 0.5-0.91, P < 0.05). T cells, CD8 T cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, B lineage, NK cells, myeloid dendritic cells, and fibroblasts were significantly different between the TP53<sub>Mut</sub> and TP53<sub>WT</sub> groups (all P < 0.05). Time - dependent ROC curves of nomogram were plotted for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival to further verify the predictive power of the nomogram for prognosis, and the AUCs were 0.78, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively. We showed there are significant differences in the immune microenvironment associated with wild-type TP53 and mutant TP53. The immune model associated with TP53 mutation has a good prediction ability for the prognosis of HNSCC and may be of reference value for other tumors with high mutation rate of TP53. Notably, the effect of TP53 mutation on the prognosis of HNSCC could be illustrated from an immunologic perspective.	2022	TP53 mutation-associated immune infiltration and a novel risk score model in HNSCC.	36248764	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC6351642	10.1038/s41598-018-37515-5	Functional paralogous ABO, GBGT1, A3GALT2, and GGTA1 genes encode blood group A and B transferases (AT and BT), Forssman glycolipid synthase (FS), isoglobotriaosylceramide synthase (iGb3S), and α1,3-galactosyltransferase (GT), respectively. These glycosyltransferases transfer N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) or d-galactose forming an α1,3-glycosidic linkage. However, their acceptor substrates are diverse. Previously, we demonstrated that the amino acids at codons 266 and 268 of human AT/BT are crucial to their distinct sugar specificities, elucidating the molecular genetic basis of the ABO glycosylation polymorphism of clinical importance in transfusion and transplantation medicine. We also prepared in vitro mutagenized ATs/BTs having any of 20 possible amino acids at those codons, and showed that those codons determine the transferase activity and sugar specificity. We have expanded structural analysis to include evolutionarily related α1,3-Gal(NAc) transferases. Eukaryotic expression constructs were prepared of AT, FS, iGb3S, and GT, possessing selected tripeptides of AT-specific AlaGlyGly or LeuGlyGly, BT-specific MetGlyAla, FS-specific GlyGlyAla, or iGb3S and GT-specific HisAlaAla, at the codons corresponding to 266-268 of human AT/BT. DNA transfection was performed using appropriate recipient cells existing and newly created, and the appearance of cell surface oligosaccharide antigens was immunologically examined. The results have shown that several tripeptides other than the originals also bestowed transferase activity. However, the repertoire of functional amino acids varied among those transferases, suggesting that structures around those codons differentially affected the interactions between donor nucleotide-sugar and acceptor substrates. It was concluded that different tripeptide sequences at the substrate-binding pocket have contributed to the generation of α1,3-Gal(NAc) transferases with diversified specificities.	2019	Amino acid substitutions at sugar-recognizing codons confer ABO blood group system-related α1,3 Gal(NAc) transferases with differential enzymatic activity.	30696937	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC9103317	10.3390/cancers14092111	Patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have poor survival outcomes, especially if it has metastasized. It is of paramount importance to identify biomarkers in genomic data that could help predict the aggressiveness of ccRCC and its resistance to drugs. Thus, we conducted a study with the aims of evaluating gene signatures and proposing a novel one with higher predictive power and generalization in comparison to the former signatures. Using ccRCC cohorts of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-KIRC) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC-RECA), we evaluated linear survival models of Cox regression with 14 signatures and six methods of feature selection, and performed functional analysis and differential gene expression approaches. In this study, we established a 13-gene signature (AR, AL353637.1, DPP6, FOXJ1, GNB3, HHLA2, IL4, LIMCH1, LINC01732, OTX1, SAA1, SEMA3G, ZIC2) whose expression levels are able to predict distinct outcomes of patients with ccRCC. Moreover, we performed a comparison between our signature and others from the literature. The best-performing gene signature was achieved using the ensemble method Min-Redundancy and Max-Relevance (mRMR). This signature comprises unique features in comparison to the others, such as generalization through different cohorts and being functionally enriched in significant pathways: Urothelial Carcinoma, Chronic Kidney disease, and Transitional cell carcinoma, Nephrolithiasis. From the 13 genes in our signature, eight are known to be correlated with ccRCC patient survival and four are immune-related. Our model showed a performance of 0.82 using the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Area Under Curve (AUC) metric and it generalized well between the cohorts. Our findings revealed two clusters of genes with high expression (SAA1, OTX1, ZIC2, LINC01732, GNB3 and IL4) and low expression (AL353637.1, AR, HHLA2, LIMCH1, SEMA3G, DPP6, and FOXJ1) which are both correlated with poor prognosis. This signature can potentially be used in clinical practice to support patient treatment care and follow-up.	2022	A Novel Machine Learning 13-Gene Signature: Improving Risk Analysis and Survival Prediction for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients.	35565241	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC9683626	10.1371/journal.pone.0273868	Cataract, a disease that causes opacity of the lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Cataracts secondary to diabetes are common, even in young patients, so they are of significant clinical importance. Here, we used an ex vivo model of galactose-induced cataracts in the rat lens to investigate the therapeutic effects of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors. Among the tested HAT inhibitors, TH1834 was the only one that could reverse most of the opacity once it had formed in the lens. Combination treatment with C646/CPTH2 and CBP30/CPTH2 also had therapeutic effects. In lens cross-sections, vacuoles were present in the tissue of the cortical equatorial region of untreated cataract samples. In treated cataract samples, lens tissue regenerated to fill the vacuoles. To identify the genes regulated by HAT inhibitors, qRT-PCR was performed on treated and untreated cataract samples to determine candidate genes. Expression of Acta1 and Stmn4, both of which are involved in the cytoskeleton, were altered significantly in C646+CPTH2 samples. Expression of Emd, a nuclear membrane protein, and Prtfdc1, which is involved in cancer cell proliferation, were altered significantly in CBP30+CPTH2 samples. Acta1, Acta2, Arrdc3, Hebp2, Hist2h2ab, Pmf1, Ppdpf, Rbm3, RGD1561694, Slc16a6, Slfn13, Tagln, Tgfb1i1, and Tuba1c in TH1834 samples were significantly altered. These genes were primarily related to regulation of cell proliferation, the cytoskeleton, and cell differentiation. Expression levels increased with the onset of cataracts and was suppressed in samples treated with HAT inhibitors.	2022	Histone acetyltransferase inhibition reverses opacity in rat galactose-induced cataract.	36417410	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
NA	10.1097/mot.0000000000000589	<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The use of genetically modified donor pigs has been integral to recent major advances in xenograft survival in preclinical nonhuman primate models. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has dramatically accelerated the development of multimodified pigs. This review examines the current and projected impact of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated donor modification on preventing rejection and potentially promoting tolerance of porcine xenografts.<h4>Recent findings</h4>CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to engineer several genetic modifications relevant to xenotransplantation into pigs, including glycosyltransferase knockouts (GGTA1, CMAH, β4GALNT2, A3GALT2 and combinations thereof), other knockouts (SLA-I, ULBP1, PERV and GHR), and one knock-in (anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody transgene knocked into GGTA1). Although the use of these pigs as donors in preclinical nonhuman primate models has been limited to a single study to date, in-vitro analysis of their cells has provided invaluable information. For example, deletion of three of the glycosyltransferases progressively decreased the binding and cytotoxicity of preexisting immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M in human sera, suggesting that this 'triple-KO' pig could be a platform for clinical xenotransplantation.<h4>Summary</h4>CRISPR-Cas9 enables the rapid generation of gene-edited pigs containing multiple tailored genetic modifications that are anticipated to have a positive impact on the efficacy and safety of pig-to-human xenotransplantation.	2019	Xenogeneic transplantation and tolerance in the era of CRISPR-Cas9.	30480643	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

However, the potential targets and mechanism of IRI are still unclear.<h4>Method</h4>Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) were performed on the GSE27274 dataset. Pathway enrichment analysis on the DEGs was performed. To identify the hub DEGs, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Finally, the hub genes were verified, and candidate drugs were screened from the DsigDB database.<h4>Results</h4>A hundred DEGs and four hub genes (<i>Atf3</i>, <i>Psmb6</i>, <i>Psmb8</i>, and <i>Psmb10</i>) were screened out. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that 100 DEGs were mainly enriched in apoptosis and the TNF signaling pathway. The four hub genes were verified in animal models and another dataset (GSE148420). Thereafter, a PPI network was used to identify the four hub genes (<i>Atf3</i>, <i>Psmb6</i>, <i>Psmb8</i>, and <i>Psmb10</i>). Finally, eight candidate drugs were identified as potential drugs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Three hub genes (<i>Psmb6</i>, <i>Psmb8</i>, and <i>Psmb10</i>) were associated with RIRI and could be potential novel biomarkers for RIRI.	2023	Identification and Verification of Potential Biomarkers in Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Integrated Bioinformatic Analysis.	36778059	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC9626462	10.1038/s41598-022-22864-z	Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of cell death, which plays a key role in the development of auto-inflammation and cancer. This study aimed to construct a pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes for predicting prognosis of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study was based primarily on the one-way analysis of variance, univariate Cox regression analysis, Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression, a risk-prognostic signature, gene set variation analysis (GSVA), and immune microenvironment analysis, using PDAC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium databases for the analysis of the role of 676 pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes in PDAC retrieved from the Reactome and GeneCards databases. Lastly, we collected six paired PDAC and matched normal adjacent tissue samples to verify the expression of signature genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We identified 18 candidate pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes that differed significantly between pathologic grades (stages) of PDAC patients. The univariate Cox and LASSO analyses pointed to six genes as the best variables for constructing a prognostic signature, including ACTA2, C1QTNF9, DNAH8, GATM, LBP, and NGF. The results of the risk prognostic model indicated that the AUCs at 1, 3, and 5 years were greater than 0.62. GSVA revealed that 'GLYCOLYSIS', 'P53 PATHWAY', 'KRAS SIGNALING UP', and 'INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE' hallmark gene sets were associated with the risk score. The high-risk group was associated with poor prognosis and was characterized by a lower infiltration of cells involved in anti-tumor immunity; whereas the low-risk group with higher T cells, NK cells, and macrophages showed relatively better survival and significantly higher upregulation of cytolytic scores and inflammation scores. Additionally, crucial pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes were further validated by qRT-PCR. Our study revealed the prognostic role of the pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes in PDAC for the first time. Simultaneously, the biological and prognostic heterogeneity of PDAC had been demonstrated, deepening our molecular understanding of this tumor.	2022	A novel refined pyroptosis and inflammasome-related genes signature for predicting prognosis and immune microenvironment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.	36319832	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC5571153	10.1038/s41598-017-09765-2	Human alleles at the ABO and GBGT1 genetic loci specify glycosylation polymorphism of ABO and FORS blood group systems, respectively, and their allelic basis has been elucidated. These genes are also present in other species, but presence/absence, as well as functionality/non-functionality are species-dependent. Molecular mechanisms and forces that created this species divergence were unknown. Utilizing genomic information available from GenBank and Ensembl databases, gene order maps were constructed of a chromosomal region surrounding the ABO and GBGT1 genes from a variety of vertebrate species. Both similarities and differences were observed in their chromosomal organization. Interestingly, the ABO and GBGT1 genes were found located at the boundaries of chromosomal fragments that seem to have been inverted/translocated during species evolution. Genetic alterations, such as deletions and duplications, are prevalent at the ends of rearranged chromosomal fragments, which may partially explain the species-dependent divergence of those clinically important glycosyltransferase genes.	2017	Evolutionary divergence of the ABO and GBGT1 genes specifying the ABO and FORS blood group systems through chromosomal rearrangements.	28839219	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
NA	10.1111/xen.12217	<h4>Background</h4>The Galα(1,3)Gal epitope (α-GAL), created by α-1,3-glycosyltransferase-1 (GGTA1), is a major xenoantigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig-to-primate and pig-to-human xenotransplantation. In response, GGTA1 gene-deleted pigs have been generated. However, it is unclear whether there is a residual small amount of α-Gal epitope expressed in GGTA1(-/-) pigs. Isoglobotrihexosylceramide synthase (iGb3s), another member of the glycosyltransferase family, catalyzes the synthesis of isoglobo-series glycosphingolipids with an α-GAL-terminal disaccharide (iGb3), creating the possibility that iGb3s may be a source of α-GAL epitopes in GGTA1(-/-) animals. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of silencing the iGb3s gene (A3GalT2) on pig-to-primate and pig-to-human immune cross-reactivity by creating and comparing GGTA1(-/-) pigs to GGTA1(-/-) - and A3GalT2(-/-) -double-knockout pigs.<h4>Methods</h4>We used the CRISPR/Cas 9 system to target the GGTA1 and A3GalT2 genes in pigs. Both GGTA1 and A3GalT2 genes are functionally inactive in humans and baboons. CRISPR-treated cells used directly for somatic cell nuclear transfer produced single- and double-gene-knockout piglets in a single pregnancy. Once grown to maturity, the glycosphingolipid profile (including iGb3) was assayed in renal tissue by normal-phase liquid chromatography. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were subjected to (i) comparative cross-match cytotoxicity analysis against human and baboon serum and (ii) IB4 staining for α-GAL/iGb3.<h4>Results</h4>Silencing of the iGb3s gene significantly modulated the renal glycosphingolipid profile and iGb3 was not detected. Moreover, the human and baboon serum PBMC cytotoxicity and α-GAL/iGb3 staining were unchanged by iGb3s silencing.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data suggest that iGb3s is not a contributor to antibody-mediated rejection in pig-to-primate or pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Although iGb3s gene silencing significantly changed the renal glycosphingolipid profile, the effect on Galα3Gal levels, antibody binding, and cytotoxic profiles of baboon and human sera on porcine PBMCs was neutral.	2016	Silencing the porcine iGb3s gene does not affect Galα3Gal levels or measures of anticipated pig-to-human and pig-to-primate acute rejection.	27106872	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

PMC5600291	10.1038/nature22034	A major goal of biomedicine is to understand the function of every gene in the human genome. Loss-of-function mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene in humans and phenotypic analysis of such 'human knockouts' can provide insight into gene function. Consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates are notably high. Here we sequence the protein-coding regions of 10,503 adult participants in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS), designed to understand the determinants of cardiometabolic diseases in individuals from South Asia. We identified individuals carrying homozygous predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) mutations, and performed phenotypic analysis involving more than 200 biochemical and disease traits. We enumerated 49,138 rare (<1% minor allele frequency) pLoF mutations. These pLoF mutations are estimated to knock out 1,317 genes, each in at least one participant. Homozygosity for pLoF mutations at PLA2G7 was associated with absent enzymatic activity of soluble lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma interleukin-8 concentrations; at TREH, with lower concentrations of apoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions; at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations; and at SLC9A3R1, with mediators of calcium and phosphate signalling. Heterozygous deficiency of APOC3 has been shown to protect against coronary heart disease; we identified APOC3 homozygous pLoF carriers in our cohort. We recruited these human knockouts and challenged them with an oral fat load. Compared with family members lacking the mutation, individuals with APOC3 knocked out displayed marked blunting of the usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides. Overall, these observations provide a roadmap for a 'human knockout project', a systematic effort to understand the phenotypic consequences of complete disruption of genes in humans.	2017	Human knockouts and phenotypic analysis in a cohort with a high rate of consanguinity.	28406212	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
NA	10.1111/tme.12455	<h4>Background</h4>ABO and its paralogues, such as A3GALT2 and GGTA1, encoding α1,3-Gal(NAc) transferases, belong to the glycosyltransferase 6 (GT6) gene family. We have developed an alternative method for the identification of species based on sequence variations within the GT6 gene family, which is applicable to degraded DNA.<h4>Methods/materials</h4>DNA samples prepared from control mammalian species, together with an unknown sample, were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified using one universal primer pair targeting the sequences in the last coding exons of the GT6 gene family, yielding 141-bp products derived from those multiple loci. After cloning, sequence determination and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis, phylogenetic trees were constructed.<h4>Results</h4>Comparison of the sequences obtained with those references showed good concordance with each of the starting species of mammals. This system was able to identify 'mouse' or 'rodent' as the origin of the unknown sample.<h4>Conclusion</h4>For the identification of species, genotyping of ABO and its homologues would be applicable for the analysis of degraded DNA samples. Although the method employed in this study is likely valid for mammals, it would not be suitable for birds, fish and reptiles. It may be possible to improve the present method for use with other species by employing an alternative universal primer set.	2017	Sequence analysis of ABO and its homologues is valid for species identification.	28850748	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of rolipram and cilostamide as cyclic Adenine monophosphate (cAMP) modulators to find the maximum cAMP levels that temporarily arrest meiosis. We determined the optimal time to maintain functional gap junction communication during pre-in vitro maturation to be four hours. Oocyte competence was evaluated by the level of glutathione, reactive oxygen species, meiotic progression, and gene expression. We evaluated embryonic developmental competence after parthenogenetic activation and somatic cell nuclear transfer. The combined treatment group showed significantly higher glutathione and lower reactive oxygen species levels and a higher maturation rate than the control and single treatment groups. Cleavage and blastocyst formation rates in parthenogenetic activation and somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos were higher in two-phase in vitro maturation than in the other groups. The relative levels of BMP15and GDF9 expression were increased in two-phase in vitro maturation.

Our study aimed to identify common signatures from different biological levels to enlighten the current unclear association between COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease (PD) as a number of possible links, and hypotheses were reported in the literature. We have analyzed transcriptome data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of both COVID-19 and PD patients, resulting in a total of 81 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The functional enrichment analysis of common DEGs are mostly involved in the complement system, type II interferon gamma (IFNG) signaling pathway, oxidative damage, microglia pathogen phagocytosis pathway, and GABAergic synapse. The protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) construction was carried out followed by hub detection, revealing 10 hub genes (MX1, IFI27, C1QC, C1QA, IFI6, NFIX, C1S, XAF1, IFI35, and ELANE). Some of the hub genes were associated with molecular mechanisms such as Lewy bodies-induced inflammation, microglia activation, and cytokine storm. We investigated regulatory elements of hub genes at transcription factor and miRNA levels. The major transcription factors regulating hub genes are SOX2, XAF1, RUNX1, MITF, and SPI1. We propose that these events may have important roles in the onset or progression of PD. To sum up, our analysis describes possible mechanisms linking COVID-19 and PD, elucidating some unknown clues in between.	2022	Discovering Common Pathogenic Mechanisms of COVID-19 and Parkinson Disease: An Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.	36301487	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

PMC9341233	10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002536	<h4>Abstract</h4>Prdm12 is a conserved epigenetic transcriptional regulator that displays restricted expression in nociceptors of the developing peripheral nervous system. In mice, Prdm12 is required for the development of the entire nociceptive lineage. In humans, PRDM12 mutations cause congenital insensitivity to pain, likely because of the loss of nociceptors. Prdm12 expression is maintained in mature nociceptors suggesting a yet-to-be explored functional role in adults. Using Prdm12 inducible conditional knockout mouse models, we report that in adult nociceptors Prdm12 is no longer required for cell survival but continues to play a role in the transcriptional control of a network of genes, many of them encoding ion channels and receptors. We found that disruption of Prdm12 alters the excitability of dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture. Phenotypically, we observed that mice lacking Prdm12 exhibit normal responses to thermal and mechanical nociceptive stimuli but a reduced response to capsaicin and hypersensitivity to formalin-induced inflammatory pain. Together, our data indicate that Prdm12 regulates pain-related behavior in a complex way by modulating gene expression in adult nociceptors and controlling their excitability. The results encourage further studies to assess the potential of Prdm12 as a target for analgesic development.	2022	Prdm12 modulates pain-related behavior by remodeling gene expression in mature nociceptors.	34961757	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

PMC8698395	10.3390/biomedicines9121840	"Acute cerebral ischemia induces distant inflammation in the hippocampus; however, molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon remain obscure. Here, hippocampal gene expression profiles were compared in two experimental paradigms in rats: middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and intracerebral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The main finding is that 10 genes (Clec5a, CD14, Fgr, Hck, Anxa1, Lgals3, Irf1, Lbp, Ptx3, Serping1) may represent key molecular links underlying acute activation of immune cells in the hippocampus in response to experimental ischemia. Functional annotation clustering revealed that these genes built the same clusters related to innate immunity/immunity/innate immune response in all MCAO differentially expressed genes and responded to the direct pro-inflammatory stimulus group. The gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses also indicate that LPS-responding genes were the most abundant among the genes related to ""positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor biosynthetic process"", ""cell adhesion"", ""TNF signaling pathway"", and ""phagosome"" as compared with non-responding ones. In contrast, positive and negative ""regulation of cell proliferation"" and ""HIF-1 signaling pathway"" mostly enriched with genes that did not respond to LPS.

Many of their cellular functions, which include plasma-membrane organization, regulation of cell signaling, endocytosis, and serving as binding sites for pathogens and endogenous receptors, have also been established. However, an understanding of their functions in vivo had been lagging. Studies employing genetic manipulations of the GSL synthesis pathways in mice have been used to systematically reduce the large numbers and complexity of GSL glycan structures, allowing the in vivo functions of GSLs to be revealed from analysis of the resulting phenotypes.

Although AMPKα1, one of the two AMPK's catalytic subunit α, expresses in the bone and stimulates bone nodule formation, the role of AMPKα2 in osteogenesis remains incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to determine the role of AMPKα2 in osteocytic MLO-Y4 cellproliferation and the expression of osteogenic markers. The current study silenced AMPKα2 in MLO-Y4 cells by transfection with pLKO.1-AMPKα2-shRNA vector and analyzed cell proliferation and the expression of osteogenic markers in MLO-Y4 cells with or without 100 μg/ml leptin treatment through CCK-8, Real-time PCR, Western blot and RNA-seq assay. We found that knockdown of AMPKα2 significantly decreased the mRNA level of AMPKα2 and the cell proliferation of MLO-Y4 cellsas well as the mRNA and protein levels of OPG, OCN, OPN, ALP and BMP6 and the protein expression of p-Smad5/Smad5. However, leptin treatment increased the MLO-Y4 cell proliferation and the expression of these osteogenic markers in MLO-Y4 cells with or without AMPKα2 silencing. Furthermore, RNA-seq assay showed 1019 transcriptors decreased in AMPKα2-silencing group and 995 transcriptors increased in leptin group compared with control group, respectively. 737 transcriptors decreased in AMPKα2-silencing group and 1282 transcriptors increased inleptin group compared with AMPKα2-silencing+leptin group, respectively. These findings suggest that AMPKα2 knockdown inhibited MLO-Y4 cell proliferation and osteogenic marker expressions, which implicates an important role of AMPKα2 in osteogenesis in vitro.	2017	Leptin inhibits AMPKα2 down-regulation induced decrease in the osteocytic MLO-Y4 cell proliferation and the expression of osteogenic markers.	31966708	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

However, the evolutionary significance of the ABO gene and its polymorphism remained unknown. We took an integrative approach to gain insights into the significance of the evolutionary process of ABO genes, including those related not only phylogenetically but also functionally. We experimentally created a code table correlating amino acid sequence motifs of the ABO gene-encoded glycosyltransferases with GalNAc (A)/galactose (B) specificity, and assigned A/B specificity to individual ABO genes from various species thus going beyond the simple sequence comparison. Together with genome information and phylogenetic analyses, this assignment revealed early appearance of A and B gene sequences in evolution and potentially non-allelic presence of both gene sequences in some animal species. We argue: Evolution may have suppressed the establishment of two independent, functional A and B genes in most vertebrates and promoted A/B conversion through amino acid substitutions and/or recombination; A/B allelism should have existed in common ancestors of primates; and bacterial ABO genes evolved through horizontal and vertical gene transmission into 2 separate groups encoding glycosyltransferases with distinct sugar specificities.	2014	An integrative evolution theory of histo-blood group ABO and related genes.	25307962	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
NA	10.1101/031518	A major goal of biomedicine is to understand the function of every gene in the human genome. Null mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene in humans and phenotypic analysis of such 'human knockouts' can provide insight into gene function. To date, comprehensive analysis of genes knocked out in humans has been limited by the fact that null mutations are infrequent in the general population and so, observing an individual homozygous null for a given gene is exceedingly rare. However, consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring who carry homozygous null mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates are notably high. Here, we sequenced the protein-coding regions of 7,078 adult participants living in Pakistan and performed phenotypic analysis to identify homozygous null individuals and to understand consequences of complete gene disruption in humans. We enumerated 36,850 rare (<1 % minor allele frequency) null mutations. These homozygous null mutations led to complete inactivation of 961 genes in at least one participant. Homozygosity for null mutations at APOC3 was associated with absent plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels; at PLAG27, with absent enzymatic activity of soluble lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma interleukin-8 concentrations; and at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations. After physiologic challenge with oral fat, APOC3 knockouts displayed marked blunting of the usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides compared to wild-type family members. These observations provide a roadmap to understand the consequences of complete disruption of a large fraction of genes in the human genome.	2015	Human knockouts in a cohort with a high rate of consanguinity	NA	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC7679335	10.1007/s10719-020-09944-w	Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) wild type (G0) plays a role in the metabolism of sphingolipids, glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin and ceramide, which constitute bioactive components of the lipid rafts (DRM). We asked whether APOL1 variants (APOL1-Vs) G1 and G2 carry the potential to alter the metabolism of sphingolipids in human podocytes. The sphingolipid pattern in HPs overexpressing either APOL1G0 or APOL1-Vs was analysed by using a thin mono- and bi-dimensional layer chromatography, mass-spectrometry and metabolic labelling with [1-<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine. HP G0 and G1/G2-Vs exhibit a comparable decrease in lactosylceramide and an increase in the globotriaosylceramide content. An analysis of the main glycohydrolases activity involved in glycosphingolipid catabolism showed an overall decrease in the activeness of the tested enzymes, irrespective of the type of APOL1-Vs expression. Similarly, the high throughput cell live-based assay showed a comparable increased action of the plasma membrane glycosphingolipid-glycohydrolases in living cells independent of the genetic APOL1 expression profile. Importantly, the most significative modification of the sphingolipid pattern induced by APOL1-Vs occurred in DRM resulted with a drastic reduction of radioactivity associated with sphingolipids. G1/G2-Vs present a decrease amount of globotriaosylceramide and globopentaosylceramide compared to G0. Additionally, ceramide at the DRM site and lactosylceramide in general, showed a greatest fall in G1/G2 in comparison with G0. Additionally, the levels of glucosylceramide decreased only in the DRM of human podocytes overexpressing G1/G2-Vs. These findings suggest that altered sphingolipidsprofiles may contribute to the deranged functionality of the plasma membrane in APOL1 risk milieu.	2020	APOL1 polymorphism modulates sphingolipid profile of human podocytes.	32915357	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

As nutrition is influential for DNA methylation, this review aims to determine if maternal nutrition during pregnancy can modify the offspring's epigenome at birth. Research focuses on micronutrients and methyl donors such as folate and B vitamins. Evidence suggests that maternal nutrition does not largely influence global methylation patterns, particularly in nutrient-replete populations; however, an important impact on gene-specific methylation is observed. A link is shown between maternal nutrition and the methylome of the offspring; however, there remains a paucity of research.

The resident immune cells of the lung play vital roles in host defense. However, the effect of perinatal events associated with BPD on pulmonary-specific immune cells is not well understood.<h4>Methods</h4>We used a double-hit model of BPD induced by prenatal chorioamnionitis followed by postnatal hyperoxia, and performed a global transcriptome analysis of all resident pulmonary immune cells.<h4>Results</h4>We show significant up-regulation of genes involved in chemokine-mediated signaling and immune cell chemotaxis, and down-regulation of genes involved in multiple T lymphocyte functions. Multiple genes involved in T cell receptor signaling are downregulated and Cd8a gene expression remains downregulated at 2 months of age in spite of recovery in normoxia for 6 weeks. Furthermore, the proportion of CD8a+CD3+ pulmonary immune cells is decreased.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study has highlighted that perinatal lung inflammation in a double-hit model of BPD results in short- and long-term dysregulation of genes associated with the pulmonary T cell receptor signaling pathway, which may contribute to increased environmental pathogen-associated respiratory morbidities seen in children and adults with BPD.<h4>Impact</h4>In a translationally relevant double-hit model of BPD induced by chorioamnionitis and postnatal hyperoxia, we identified pulmonary immune cell-specific transcriptomic changes and showed that T cell receptor signaling genes are downregulated in short term and long term. This is the first comprehensive report delineating transcriptomic changes in resident immune cells of the lung in a translationally relevant double-hit model of BPD.

Previous reports suggest that glycans, the most common posttranslational modifications, are involved in obesity-related diseases, but what type of glycan regulates adipogenesis during obesity remains unclear. In this study, we first quantified the mRNA levels of 167 genes (encoding 144 glycosyltransferases and 23 related enzymes) in visceral adipose tissues (VATs) from control mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. We found that a gene encoding β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase-1 (<i>St6gal1</i>), a key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of α2,6-linked sialic acid in <i>N</i>-linked glycans, was most down-regulated in VATs from obese mice. We confirmed the reduction in α2,6-sialic acid in VATs from obese mice and differentiated adipocyte model 3T3-L1 cells. Using proteomic analysis, integrin-β1 was identified as one of the target α2,6-sialylated proteins in adipose tissues, and phosphorylation of its downstream molecule focal adhesion kinase was found to be decreased after HFD feeding. <i>St6gal1</i> overexpression in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells inhibited adipogenesis with increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. Furthermore, <i>St6gal1</i> knockout mice exhibited increased bodyweight and VAT weight after HFD feeding. The down-regulation of <i>St6gal1</i> during adipogenesis was canceled by treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, suggesting an involvement of epigenetic DNA methylation in <i>St6gal1</i> silencing. Our findings suggest that ST6GAL1 has an inhibitory role in adipogenesis through integrin-β1 activation, providing new insights into the roles and regulation mechanisms of glycans in adipocytes during obesity.	2017	The Inhibitory Role of α2,6-Sialylation in Adipogenesis.	28031460	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

GBGT1 gene encodes Forssman glycolipid synthase (FS), another glycosyltransferase that produces Forssman antigen (FORS1). Humans are considered to be Forssman antigen-negative species without functional FS. However, rare individuals exhibiting A<sub>pae</sub> phenotype carry a dominant active GBGT1 gene and express Forssman antigen on RBCs. Accordingly, FORS system was recognized as the 31st blood group system. Mouse ABO gene encodes a cis-AB transferase capable of producing both A and B antigens. This murine enzyme contains the same GlyGlyAla tripeptide sequence as FSs at the position important for the determination of sugar specificity. We, therefore, transfected the expression construct into appropriate recipient cells and examined whether mouse cis-AB transferase may also exhibit FS activity. The result was positive, confirming the crosstalk between the ABO and FORS systems. Further experiments have revealed that the introduction of this tripeptide sequence to human A transferase conferred some, although weak, FS activity, suggesting that it is also involved in the recognition/binding of acceptor substrates, in addition to donor nucleotide-sugars.	2017	Crosstalk between ABO and Forssman (FORS) blood group systems: FORS1 antigen synthesis by ABO gene-encoded glycosyltransferases.	28134301	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

Beneficial effects are observed in patients with psychiatric disorders and enhancement of brain performance in healthy individuals has been observed following tDCS. However, few studies have attempted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of tDCS in the brain. This study was conducted to assess the impact of tDCS on gene expression within the rat cerebral cortex. Anodal tDCS was applied at 3 different intensities followed by RNA-sequencing and analysis. In each current intensity, approximately 1,000 genes demonstrated statistically significant differences compared to the sham group. A variety of functional pathways, biological processes, and molecular categories were found to be modified by tDCS. The impact of tDCS on gene expression was dependent on current intensity. Results show that inflammatory pathways, antidepressant-related pathways (GTP signaling, calcium ion binding, and transmembrane/signal peptide pathways), and receptor signaling pathways (serotonergic, adrenergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and glutamate) were most affected. Of the gene expression profiles induced by tDCS, some changes were observed across multiple current intensities while other changes were unique to a single stimulation intensity. This study demonstrates that tDCS can modify the expression profile of various genes in the cerebral cortex and that these tDCS-induced alterations are dependent on the current intensity applied.	2016	Transcriptomic Modification in the Cerebral Cortex following Noninvasive Brain Stimulation: RNA-Sequencing Approach.	28119786	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

It is known that untranslated regions of the RNA can play a role in these processes. Here we show that THOC5, a member of the TREX (transcription/export) complex, plays a role in expression of only a subset of constitutively active genes, however transcriptome analysis reveals that more than 90% of IEG were not induced by serum in THOC5 depleted cells. Furthermore, THOC5 depletion does not influence the expression of the most rapidly induced IEGs, e.g. Fos and Jun. One group of THOC5 target genes, including Id1, Id3 and Wnt11 transcripts, were not released from chromatin in THOC5 depleted cells. Genes in another group, including Myc and Smad7 transcripts, were released with shortening of 3'UTR by alternative cleavage, and were spliced but export was impaired in THOC5 depleted cells. By interactome analysis using THOC5 as bait, we show that upon stimulation with serum THOC5 forms a complex with polyadenylation-specific factor 100 (CPSF100). THOC5 is required for recruitment of CPSF100 to 3'UTR of THOC5 target genes. These data suggest the presence of a novel mechanism for the control of IEG response by THOC5 via 3'end-processing.	2014	THOC5 controls 3'end-processing of immediate early genes via interaction with polyadenylation specific factor 100 (CPSF100).	25274738	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

Therefore, humans can produce high antibody titers against α-Gal. Anti-α-Gal IgE antibodies have been associated with tick-induced allergy (i.e. α-Gal syndrome) and anti-α-Gal IgG/IgM antibodies may be involved in protection against malaria, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. The α-Gal on tick salivary proteins plays an important role in the etiology of the α-Gal syndrome. However, whether ticks are able to produce endogenous α-Gal remains currently unknown. In this study, the Ixodes scapularis genome was searched for galactosyltransferases and three genes were identified as potentially involved in the synthesis of α-Gal. Heterologous gene expression in α-Gal-negative cells and gene knockdown in ticks confirmed that these genes were involved in α-Gal synthesis and are essential for tick feeding. Furthermore, these genes were shown to play an important role in tick-pathogen interactions. Results suggested that tick cells increased α-Gal levels in response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection to control bacterial infection.

This review summarizes the contribution of anti-nonGal xenoantibodies to the activation of porcine endothelial cells and graft rejection, and further provides an update on recent advancements in defining the unique features of anti-nonGal xenoantibody structure.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Anti-nonGal xenoantibodies pre-exist at low levels in humans and nonhuman primates, and are notably absent in neonates. Exposure of nonhuman primates to alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knockout endothelial cells initiates an induced xenoantibody response that is restricted and encoded by the germline immunoglobulin heavy chain gene IGHV3-21. The target xenoantigen remains undetermined, but several candidate targets have been proposed, including carbohydrate xenoantigens. New advancements in molecular modeling provide insight on the mechanism by which xenoantibodies bind to structurally related carbohydrates.<h4>Summary</h4>Genetic manipulation of porcine donors has significantly prolonged the survival of grafts placed into nonhuman primate recipients, but anti-nonGal xenoantibodies and thrombosis limit the ability of these grafts to function on a long-term basis. Recent developments defining pre-existing anti-nonGal xenoantibody levels, the restriction in the anti-nonGal xenoantibody response and the identification of key sites defining xenoantibody-carbohydrate interactions now provide the information necessary to develop new approaches to preventing xenoantibody-mediated rejection.	2010	The anti-nonGal xenoantibody response to alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knockout pig xenografts.	20075731	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

Since high-quality gene expression studies have enduring value as resources to the entire research community, it is of particular importance that small labs have the capacity to share their analyzed datasets with the research community. Here we introduce ExpressionDB, an open source platform for visualizing RNA-seq and microarray data accommodating virtually any number of different samples. ExpressionDB is based on Shiny, a customizable web application which allows data sharing locally and online with customizable code written in R. ExpressionDB allows intuitive searches based on gene symbols, descriptions, or gene ontology terms, and it includes tools for dynamically filtering results based on expression level, fold change, and false-discovery rates. Built-in visualization tools include heatmaps, volcano plots, and principal component analysis, ensuring streamlined and consistent visualization to all users. All of the scripts for building an ExpressionDB with user-supplied data are freely available on GitHub, and the Creative Commons license allows fully open customization by end-users. We estimate that a demo database can be created in under one hour with minimal programming experience, and that a new database with user-supplied expression data can be completed and online in less than one day.	2017	ExpressionDB: An open source platform for distributing genome-scale datasets.	29095940	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC6420026	10.1371/journal.pbio.3000169	CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells represent a heterogeneous population of lipid-reactive T cells that are involved in many immune responses, mediated through T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent and/or independent activation. Although numerous microbial lipid antigens (Ags) have been identified, several lines of evidence have suggested the existence of relevant Ags of endogenous origin. However, the identification of their precise nature as well as the molecular mechanisms involved in their generation are still highly controversial and ill defined. Here, we identified two mammalian gangliosides-namely monosialoganglioside GM3 and disialoganglioside GD3-as endogenous activators for mouse iNKT cells. These glycosphingolipids are found in Toll-like receptor-stimulated dendritic cells (DC) as several species varying in their N-acyl fatty chain composition. Interestingly, their ability to activate iNKT cells is highly dependent on the ceramide backbone structure. Thus, both synthetic GM3 and GD3 comprising a d18:1-C24:1 ceramide backbone were able to activate iNKT cells in a CD1d-dependent manner. GM3 and GD3 are not directly recognized by the iNKT TCR and required the Ag presenting cell intracellular machinery to reveal their antigenicity. We propose a new concept in which iNKT cells can rapidly respond to pre-existing self-molecules after stress-induced structural changes in CD1d-expressing cells. Moreover, these gangliosides conferred partial protection in the context of bacterial infection. Thus, this report identified new biologically relevant lipid self-Ags for iNKT cells.	2019	TLR9-mediated dendritic cell activation uncovers mammalian ganglioside species with specific ceramide backbones that activate invariant natural killer T cells.	30822302	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC1851602	10.1073/pnas.0611139104	CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells, expressing the invariant T cell antigen receptor (TCR) chain encoded by Valpha14-Jalpha18 gene segments in mice and Valpha24-Jalpha18 in humans [invariant NKT (iNKT) cells], contribute to immunoregulatory processes, such as tolerance, host defense, and tumor surveillance. iNKT cells are positively selected in the thymus by CD1d molecules expressed by CD4(+)/CD8(+) cortical thymocytes. However, the identity of the endogenous lipid(s) responsible for positive selection of iNKT cells remains unclear. One candidate lipid proposed to play a role in positive selection is isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3). However, no direct evidence for its physiological role has been provided. Therefore, to directly investigate the role of iGb3 in iNKT cell selection, we have generated mice deficient in iGb3 synthase [iGb3S, also known as alpha1-3galactosyltransferase 2 (A3galt2)]. These mice developed, grew, and reproduced normally and exhibited no overt behavioral abnormalities. Consistent with the notion that iGb3 is synthesized only by iGb3S, lack of iGb3 in the dorsal root ganglia of iGb3S-deficient mice (iGb3S(-/-)), as compared with iGb3S(+/-) mice, was confirmed. iGb3S(-/-) mice showed normal numbers of iNKT cells in the thymus, spleen, and liver with selected TCR Vbeta chains identical to controls. Upon administration of alpha-galactosylceramide, activation of iNKT and dendritic cells was similar in iGb3S(-/-) and iGb3S(+/-) mice, as measured by up-regulation of CD69 as well as intracellular IL-4 and IFN-gamma in iNKT cells, up-regulation of CD86 on dendritic cells, and rise in serum concentrations of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and Ccl2/MCP-1. Our results strongly suggest that iGb3 is unlikely to be an endogenous CD1d lipid ligand determining thymic iNKT selection.	2007	Normal development and function of invariant natural killer T cells in mice with isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3) deficiency.	17372206	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

The antigen is present in various species, but not in others including humans. We have elucidated the molecular genetic basis of the Forssman antigen negativity in humans. In the human GBGT1 gene, we identified two common inactivating missense mutations (c.688G>A [p.Gly230Ser] and c.887A>G [p.Gln296Arg]). The reversion of the two mutations fully restored the glycosyltransferase activity to synthesize the Forssman antigen in vitro. These glycine and glutamine residues are conserved among functional GBGT1 genes in Forssman-positive species. Furthermore, the glycine and serine residues represent those at the corresponding position of the human blood group A and B transferases with GalNAc and galactose specificity, respectively, implicating the crucial role the glycine residue may play in the FS α1,3-GalNAc transferase activity.	2012	Molecular genetic basis of the human Forssman glycolipid antigen negativity.	23240079	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC5434122	10.1007/s00005-017-0461-y	Contrary to general view that the MHC Class I and II are the kapellmeisters of recognition and response to antigens, there is another big player in that part of immunity, represented by CD1 glycoproteins. In contrast to MHC Class I or II, which present peptides, CD1 molecules present lipids. Humans express five CD1 proteins (CD1a-e), four of which (CD1a-d) are trafficked to the cell surface, where they may display lipid antigens to T-cell receptors. This interaction may lead to both non-cognate and cognate T cell help to B cells, the latter eliciting anti-lipid antibody response. All CD1 proteins can bind a broad range of structurally different exogenous and endogenous lipids, but each shows a preference to one or more lipid classes. This unorthodox binding behavior is the result of elaborate architectures of CD1 binding clefts and distinct intracellular trafficking routes. Together, these features make CD1 system a versatile player in immune response, sitting at the crossroads of innate and adaptive immunity. While CD1 system may be involved in numerous infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases, its involvement may lead to opposite outcomes depending on different pathologies. Despite these ambiguities and complexity, CD1 system draws growing attention and continues to show glimmers of therapeutic potential. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about CD1 proteins, their structures, lipid-binding profiles, and roles in immunity, and evaluate the role of CD1 proteins in eliciting humoral immune response.	2017	CD1: A Singed Cat of the Three Antigen Presentation Systems.	28386696	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC6609624	10.1038/s41598-019-46029-7	Human histo-blood group A transferase (AT) catalyzes the biosynthesis of oligosaccharide A antigen important in blood transfusion and cell/tissue/organ transplantation. This enzyme may synthesize Forssman antigen (FORS1) of the FORS blood group system when exon 3 or 4 of the AT mRNA is deleted and/or the LeuGlyGly tripeptide at codons 266-268 of AT is replaced by GlyGlyAla. The Met69Ser/Thr substitutions also confer weak Forssman glycolipid synthase (FS) activity. In this study, we prepared the human AT derivative constructs containing any of the 20 amino acids at codon 69 with and without the GlyGlyAla substitution, transfected DNA to newly generated COS1(B3GALNT1 + A4GALT) cells expressing an enhanced level of globoside (Gb4), the FS acceptor substrate, and immunologically examined the FORS1 expression. Our results showed that all those substitution constructs at codon 69 exhibited FS activity. The combination with GlyGlyAla significantly increased the activity. The conserved methionine residue in the ABO, but not GBGT1, gene-encoded proteins may implicate its contribution to the separation of these genes in genetic evolution. Surprisingly, with increased Gb4 availability, the original human AT with the methionine residue at codon 69 was also demonstrated to synthesize FORS1, providing another molecular mechanism of FORS1 appearance in cancer of ordinary FORS1-negative individuals.	2019	ABO blood group A transferase and its codon 69 substitution enzymes synthesize FORS1 antigen of FORS blood group system.	31273262	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC6020805	10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017293	Blood group A/B glycosyltransferases (AT/BTs) and Forssman glycolipid synthase (FS) are encoded by the evolutionarily related <i>ABO</i> (A/B alleles) and <i>GBGT1</i> genes, respectively. AT/BT and FS catalyze the biosynthesis of A/B and Forssman (FORS1) oligosaccharide antigens that are responsible for the distinct blood group systems of ABO and FORS. Using genetic engineering, DNA transfection, and immunocytochemistry and immunocytometry, we have previously shown that the eukaryotic expression construct encoding human AT, whose LeuGlyGly tripeptide at codons 266 to 268 was replaced with FS-specific GlyGlyAla tripeptide, induced weak appearance of FORS1 antigen. Recently, we have shown that the human AT complementary DNA constructs deleting exons 3 or 4, but not exons 2 or 5, induced moderate expression of FORS1 antigen. The constructs containing both the GlyGlyAla substitution and the exon 3 or 4 deletion exhibited an increased FS activity. Here, we report another molecular mechanism in which an amino acid substitution at codon 69 from methionine to threonine or serine (Met69Thr/Ser) also modified enzymatic specificity and permitted FORS1 biosynthesis. Considering that codon 69 is the first amino acid of exon 5 and that the cointroduction of Met69Thr and GlyGlyAla substitutions also enhanced FS activity, the methionine substitutions may affect enzyme structure in a mode similar to the exon 3 or 4 deletion but distinct from the GlyGlyAla substitution.	2018	Blood group <i>ABO</i> gene-encoded A transferase catalyzes the biosynthesis of FORS1 antigen of FORS system upon Met69Thr/Ser substitution.	29898878	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

Humans are a Forssman antigen-negative species; however, rare individuals with A<sub>pae</sub> phenotype express FORS1 on their red blood cells. We previously demonstrated that the replacement of the LeuGlyGly tripeptide sequence at codons 266 to 268 of human AT with <i>GBGT1</i>-encoded FS-specific GlyGlyAla enabled the enzyme to produce FORS1 antigen, although the FS activity was weak. We searched for additional molecular mechanisms that might allow human AT to express FORS1. A variety of derivative expression constructs of human AT were prepared. DNA was transfected into COS1 (B3GALNT1) cells, and cell-surface expression of FORS1 was immunologically monitored. To our surprise, the deletion of exon 3 or 4, but not of exon 2 or 5, of human AT transcripts bestowed moderate FS activity, indicating that the A allele is inherently capable of producing a protein with FS activity. Because RNA splicing is frequently altered in cancer, this mechanism may explain, at least partially, the appearance of FORS1 in human cancer. Furthermore, strong FS activity was attained, in addition to AT and BT activities, by cointroducing 1 of those deletions and the GlyGlyAla substitution, possibly by the synergistic effects of altered intra-Golgi localization/conformation by the former and modified enzyme specificity by the latter.	2017	ABO blood group A transferases catalyze the biosynthesis of FORS blood group FORS1 antigen upon deletion of exon 3 or 4.	29296927	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

Now other glycan antigens are barriers to move ahead with xenotransplantation, and the N-glycolyl neuraminic acid, Neu5Gc (or Hanganutziu-Deicher antigen), is also a major pig xenoantigen. Humans have anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Several data indicate a strong immunogenicity of Neu5Gc in humans that may contribute to an important part in antibody-dependent injury to pig xenografts. Pig islets express Neu5Gc, which reacted with diet-derived human antibodies and mice deleted for Neu5Gc reject pancreatic islets from wild-type counterpart. However, Neu5Gc positive heart were not rejected in Neu5Gc KO mice indicating that the role of Neu5Gc-specific antibodies has to be nuanced and depend of the graft situation parameters (organ/tissue, recipient, implication of other glycan antigens). Recently generated Gal/Neu5Gc KO pigs eliminate the expression of Gal and Neu5Gc, and improve the crossmatch of humans with the pig.

PMC4798880	10.1016/j.heares.2015.10.010	Our previous RNA-sequencing analysis of the rat cochlear genes identified multiple biological processes and molecular pathways in the cochlear response to acoustic overstimulation. However, the biological processes and molecular pathways that are common to other species have not been documented. The identification of these common stress processes is pivotal for a better understanding of the essential response of the cochlea to acoustic injury. Here, we compared the RNA-sequencing data collected from mice and rats that sustained a similar, but not identical, acoustic injury. The transcriptome analysis of cochlear genes identified the differentially expressed genes in the mouse and rat samples. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a marked similarity in the changes in the biological processes between the two species, although the differentially expressed genes did not overlap well. The common processes associated with the differentially expressed genes are primarily associated with immunity and inflammation, which include the immune response, response to wounding, the defense response, chemotaxis and inflammatory responses. Moreover, analysis of the molecular pathways showed considerable overlap between the two species. The common pathways include cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the chemokine signaling pathway, the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. Further analysis of the transcriptional regulators revealed common upstream regulators of the differentially expressed genes, and these upstream regulators are also functionally related to the immune and inflammatory responses. These results suggest that the immune and inflammatory responses are the essential responses to acoustic overstimulation in the cochlea.	2016	Immune defense is the primary function associated with the differentially expressed genes in the cochlea following acoustic trauma.	26520584	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC7949097	10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100299	The human Gb3/CD77 synthase, encoded by the A4GALT gene, is an unusually promiscuous glycosyltransferase. It synthesizes the Galα1→4Gal linkage on two different glycosphingolipids (GSLs), producing globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, CD77, P<sup>k</sup>) and the P1 antigen. Gb3 is the major receptor for Shiga toxins (Stxs) produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. A single amino acid substitution (p.Q211E) ramps up the enzyme's promiscuity, rendering it able to attach Gal both to another Gal residue and to GalNAc, giving rise to NOR1 and NOR2 GSLs. Human Gb3/CD77 synthase was long believed to transfer Gal only to GSL acceptors, therefore its GSL products were, by default, considered the only human Stx receptors. Here, using soluble, recombinant human Gb3/CD77 synthase and p.Q211E mutein, we demonstrate that both enzymes can synthesize the P1 glycotope (terminal Galα1→4Galβ1→4GlcNAc-R) on a complex type N-glycan and a synthetic N-glycoprotein (saposin D). Moreover, by transfection of CHO-Lec2 cells with vectors encoding human Gb3/CD77 synthase and its p.Q211E mutein, we demonstrate that both enzymes produce P1 glycotopes on N-glycoproteins, with the mutein exhibiting elevated activity. These P1-terminated N-glycoproteins are recognized by Stx1 but not Stx2 B subunits. Finally, cytotoxicity assays show that Stx1 can use P1 N-glycoproteins produced in CHO-Lec2 cells as functional receptors. We conclude that Stx1 can recognize and use P1 N-glycoproteins in addition to its canonical GSL receptors to enter and kill the cells, while Stx2 can use GSLs only. Collectively, these results may have important implications for our understanding of the Shiga toxin pathology.	2021	Human Gb3/CD77 synthase produces P1 glycotope-capped N-glycans, which mediate Shiga toxin 1 but not Shiga toxin 2 cell entry.	33460651	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

We identified a high incidence of genetic aberrations, which included somatic mutations in RNASEL, PEG10, TNFSF15, TP53, TGFB2, and FAT1. Copy number analysis revealed a complex chromosomal rearrangement of chromosome 8, which resulted in gene fusion between MCM4 and SNTB1 and dramatic amplification of MYC and NDRG1. Focal deletion was detected at human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles, which was previously observed in thymic epithelial tumors. We further investigated fusion transcripts using RNA-seq data and found an intergenic splicing event between the CTBS and GNG5 transcript.

However, we detect extensive dynamic epigenetic changes in intestinal stem cells and their progeny during the suckling period, suggesting postnatal epigenetic development in this stem cell population. We find that postnatal DNA methylation increases at 3' CpG islands (CGIs) correlate with transcriptional activation of glycosylation genes responsible for intestinal maturation. To directly test whether 3' CGI methylation regulates transcription, we conditionally disrupted two major DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt1 or Dnmt3a, in fetal and adult intestine. Deficiency of Dnmt1 causes severe intestinal abnormalities in neonates and disrupts crypt homeostasis in adults, whereas Dnmt3a loss was compatible with intestinal development. These studies reveal that 3' CGI methylation is functionally involved in the regulation of transcriptional activation in vivo, and that Dnmt1 is a critical regulator of postnatal epigenetic changes in intestinal stem cells. Finally, we show that postnatal 3' CGI methylation and associated gene activation in intestinal epithelial cells are significantly altered by germ-free conditions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results demonstrate that the suckling period is critical for epigenetic development of intestinal stem cells, with potential important implications for lifelong gut health, and that the gut microbiome guides and/or facilitates these postnatal epigenetic processes.	2015	Postnatal epigenetic regulation of intestinal stem cells requires DNA methylation and is guided by the microbiome.	26420038	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

Mutations in this part of the genome-the GTf-genome-cause more than 58 rare, monogenic congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). They are also statistically associated with a large number of complex phenotypes, diseases or predispositions to complex diseases based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). CDGs are extremely rare and often with severe medical consequences. In contrast, GWAS are likely to identify more common genetic variations and generally involve less severe and distinct traits. We recently confirmed that structural defects in GTf genes are extremely rare, which seemed at odds with the large number of GWAS pointing to GTf-genes. To resolve this issue, we surveyed the GTf-genome for reported CDGs and GWAS candidates; we found little overlap between the two groups of genes. Moreover, GTf-genes implicated by CDG or GWAS appear to constitute different classes with respect to their: (i) predicted roles in glycosylation pathways; (ii) potential for partial redundancy by closely homologous genes; and (iii) transcriptional regulation as evaluated by RNAseq data. Our analysis suggest that more complex traits are caused by dysregulation rather than structural deficiency of GTfs, which suggests that some glycosylation reactions may be predicted to be under tight regulation for fine-tuning of important biological functions.	2018	Glycosyltransferase genes that cause monogenic congenital disorders of glycosylation are distinct from glycosyltransferase genes associated with complex diseases.	29579191	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

We generated IgM and IgG gene libraries using peripheral blood lymphocytes of rhesus monkeys initiating active xenoantibody responses after immunization with GalTKO pig endothelial cells and used these libraries to identify IgV(H) genes that encode antibody responses to non-gal pig xenoantigens. Immunoglobulin genes derived from the IGHV3-21 germline progenitor encode xenoantibodies directed at non-gal xenoantigens. Transduction of GalTKO cells with lentiviral vectors expressing the porcine alpha1,3 galactosyltransferase gene responsible for gal carbohydrate expression results in a higher level of binding of 'anti-non-gal' xenoantibodies to transduced GalTKO cells expressing the gal carbohydrate, suggesting that anti-non-gal xenoantibodies cross react with carbohydrate xenoantigens. The galactosyltransferase two gene encoding isoglobotriaosylceramide synthase (iGb3 synthase) is not expressed in GalTKO pig cells.

However, off-target effects must be considered. Predicting these effects is complicated. Each miRNA may target many gene transcripts, and the rules governing imperfectly complementary miRNA: target interactions are incompletely understood. Several databases provide lists of the relatively small number of experimentally confirmed miRNA: target pairs. Although incomplete, this information might allow assessment of at least some of the off-target effects. We evaluated the performance of four databases of experimentally validated miRNA: target interactions (miRWalk 2.0, miRTarBase, miRecords, and TarBase 7.0) using a list of 50 alphabetically consecutive genes. We examined the provided citations to determine the degree to which each interaction was experimentally supported. To assess stability, we tested at the beginning and end of a five-month period. Results varied widely by database. Two of the databases changed significantly over the course of 5 months. Most reported evidence for miRNA: target interactions were indirect or otherwise weak, and relatively few interactions were supported by more than one publication. Some returned results appear to arise from simplistic text searches that offer no insight into the relationship of the search terms, may not even include the reported gene or miRNA, and may thus, be invalid. We conclude that validation databases provide important information, but not all information in all extant databases is up-to-date or accurate. Nevertheless, the more comprehensive validation databases may provide useful starting points for investigation of off-target effects of proposed small RNA therapies.	2015	Validated MicroRNA Target Databases: An Evaluation.	26286669	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol

However, iNKT cells also show some reactivity to 'self'. Here, I outline our current understanding of iNKT cell autoreactivity and propose that several self lipids are probably involved in the positive selection and autoreactivity of iNKT cells.	2010	iNKT cell autoreactivity: what is 'self' and how is it recognized?	20224567	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC2542847	10.1172/jci34378	Asthma is a complex heritable disease that is increasing in prevalence and severity, particularly in developed countries such as the United States, where 11% of the population is affected. The contribution of environmental and genetic factors to this growing epidemic is currently not well understood. We developed the hypothesis, based on previous literature, that changes in DNA methylation resulting in aberrant gene transcription may enhance the risk of developing allergic airway disease. Our findings indicate that in mice, a maternal diet supplemented with methyl donors enhanced the severity of allergic airway disease that was inherited transgenerationally. Using a genomic approach, we discovered 82 gene-associated loci that were differentially methylated after in utero supplementation with a methyl-rich diet. These methylation changes were associated with decreased transcriptional activity and increased disease severity. Runt-related transcription factor 3 (Runx3), a gene known to negatively regulate allergic airway disease, was found to be excessively methylated, and Runx3 mRNA and protein levels were suppressed in progeny exposed in utero to a high-methylation diet. Moreover, treatment with a demethylating agent increased Runx3 gene transcription, further supporting our claim that a methyl-rich diet can affect methylation status and consequent transcriptional regulation. Our findings indicate that dietary factors can modify the heritable risk of allergic airway disease through epigenetic mechanisms during a vulnerable period of fetal development in mice.	2008	In utero supplementation with methyl donors enhances allergic airway disease in mice.	18802477	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC6008200	10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001217	Molecular neurobiological insight into human nervous tissues is needed to generate next-generation therapeutics for neurological disorders such as chronic pain. We obtained human dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) samples from organ donors and performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the hDRG transcriptional landscape, systematically comparing it with publicly available data from a variety of human and orthologous mouse tissues, including mouse DRG (mDRG). We characterized the hDRG transcriptional profile in terms of tissue-restricted gene coexpression patterns and putative transcriptional regulators, and formulated an information-theoretic framework to quantify DRG enrichment. Relevant gene families and pathways were also analyzed, including transcription factors, G-protein-coupled receptors, and ion channels. Our analyses reveal an hDRG-enriched protein-coding gene set (∼140), some of which have not been described in the context of DRG or pain signaling. Most of these show conserved enrichment in mDRG and were mined for known drug-gene product interactions. Conserved enrichment of the vast majority of transcription factors suggests that the mDRG is a faithful model system for studying hDRG, because of evolutionarily conserved regulatory programs. Comparison of hDRG and tibial nerve transcriptomes suggests trafficking of neuronal mRNA to axons in adult hDRG, and are consistent with studies of axonal transport in rodent sensory neurons. We present our work as an online, searchable repository (https://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/painneurosciencelab/sensoryomics/drgtxome), creating a valuable resource for the community. Our analyses provide insight into DRG biology for guiding development of novel therapeutics and a blueprint for cross-species transcriptomic analyses.	2018	Comparative transcriptome profiling of the human and mouse dorsal root ganglia: an RNA-seq-based resource for pain and sensory neuroscience research.	29561359	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC3014036	10.1681/asn.2010050561	Identifying the genes underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL) for disease is difficult, mainly because of the low resolution of the approach and the complex genetics involved. However, recent advances in bioinformatics and the availability of genetic resources now make it possible to narrow the genetic intervals, test candidate genes, and define pathways affected by these QTL. In this study, we mapped three significant QTL and one suggestive QTL for an increased albumin-to-creatinine ratio on chromosomes (Chrs) 1, 4, 15, and 17, respectively, in a cross between the inbred MRL/MpJ and SM/J strains of mice. By combining data from several sources and by utilizing gene expression data, we identified Tlr12 as a likely candidate for the Chr 4 QTL. Through the mapping of 33,881 transcripts measured by microarray on kidney RNA from each of the 173 male F2 animals, we identified several downstream pathways associated with these QTL, including the glycan degradation, leukocyte migration, and antigen-presenting pathways. We demonstrate that by combining data from multiple sources, we can identify not only genes that are likely to be causal candidates for QTL but also the pathways through which these genes act to alter phenotypes. This combined approach provides valuable insights into the causes and consequences of renal disease.	2011	Uncovering genes and regulatory pathways related to urinary albumin excretion.	21030601	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC3868636	10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.05.038	Acoustic trauma, a leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss in adults, induces a complex degenerative process in the cochlea. Although previous investigations have identified multiple stress pathways, a comprehensive analysis of cochlear responses to acoustic injury is still lacking. In the current study, we used the next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) technique to sequence the whole transcriptome of the normal and noise-traumatized cochlear sensory epithelia (CSE). CSE tissues were collected from rat inner ears 1d after the rats were exposed to a 120-dB (sound pressure level) noise for 2 h. The RNA-Seq generated over 176 million sequence reads for the normal CSE and over 164 million reads for the noise-traumatized CSE. Alignment of these sequences with the rat Rn4 genome revealed the expression of over 17,000 gene transcripts in the CSE, over 2000 of which were exclusively expressed in either the normal or noise-traumatized CSE. Seventy-eight gene transcripts were differentially expressed (70 upregulated and 8 downregulated) after acoustic trauma. Many of the differentially expressed genes are related to the innate immune system. Further expression analyses using quantitative real time PCR confirmed the constitutive expression of multiple complement genes in the normal organ of Corti and the changes in the expression levels of the complement factor I (Cfi) and complement component 1, s subcomponent (C1s) after acoustic trauma. Moreover, protein expression analysis revealed strong expression of Cfi and C1s proteins in the organ of Corti. Importantly, these proteins exhibited expression changes following acoustic trauma. Collectively, the results of the current investigation suggest the involvement of the complement components in cochlear responses to acoustic trauma.	2013	Transcriptome characterization by RNA-Seq reveals the involvement of the complement components in noise-traumatized rat cochleae.	23727008	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
NA	10.21203/rs.3.rs-991635/v1	<h4>Background: </h4> With the worldwide spread of COVID-19, people’s health and social order have been exposed to enormous risks. After encountering patients who test positive again after discharge, our study analyzed the pathogenesis to further assess the risk and possibility of virus reactivation. <h4>Methods: </h4>: A separate microarray was acquired from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO), and its samples were divided into two groups: a “convalescent-RTP” group consisting of recovery and “retesting-positive” (RTP) patients (group CR) and a “health-RTP” group consisting of healthy control and RTP patients (group HR). The enrichment analysis was performed with R software, obtaining the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto pluripotent stem cells (KEGG) of the genes and genomes. Subsequently, the protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of each group were established and the hub genes were discovered using the cytoHubba plug-in. <h4>Results: </h4>: In this study, 20 differentially expressed genes were identified, and 6622 genes were identified in the group CR, consisting of 5003 up-regulated and 1619 down-regulated genes. Meanwhile, 7335 genes were screened in the group HR, including 4323 up-regulated and 3012 down-regulated ones. The GO and KEGG analysis of the two groups revealed significant enrichment of these differentially expressed genes in pathways associated with immune response and apoptosis. In the PPI network constructed, 10 hub genes in group CR were identified, including TP53BP1, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SF3B1, SNRNP200, MRPS16, MRPS9, CALM1, PPP2R1A, YWHAZ. Similarly, TP53BP1, RPS15, EFTUD2, MRPL16, MRPL17, MRPS14, RPL35A, MRPL32, MRPS6, POLR2G were selected as hub genes. <h4>Conclusions: </h4>: Using the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression data from GSE166253, we explore the pathogenesis of retesting positive in COVID-19 from the immune mechanism and molecular level. We found TP53BP1, SNRPD1 and SNRPD2 as hub genes in RTP patients. Hence, their regulatory pathway is vital to the management and prognostic prediction of RTP patients, rendering the further study of these hub genes necessary.	2021	Screening the Hub Genes and Analyzing the Mechanisms in Discharged COVID-19 Patients Retesting Positive through Bioinformatics Analysis	NA	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC3860588	10.1159/000213505	<h4>Background</h4>Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), the best characterized animal model of experimental membranous nephropathy, is characterized by subepithelial immune deposits, podocyte foot processes effacement and massive proteinuria beginning 4 days following disease induction. Although single genes involved in PHN have been studied, no whole genome-wide expression analysis of kidney tissue has been performed.<h4>Methods</h4>Microarray analysis was performed to identify gene expression changes in PHN rat kidneys during the onset of proteinuria.<h4>Results</h4>Our results showed that 234 transcripts were differentially expressed in diseased animals compared to controls. Genes exclusively upregulated in diseased animals were mainly required for cell structure and motility, immunity and defense, cell cycle, and developmental processes. The single most increased gene was transgelin (Tagln) showing a 70-fold upregulation in animals with PHN. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed the following four processes of major relevance in disease manifestation: (i) DNA damage and repair; (ii) changes in the extracellular matrix; (iii) deregulation of cytokines and growth factors, as well as (iv) rearrangements of the cytoskeleton.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We show for the first time the complex interplay between multiple different genes in experimental membranous nephropathy, supporting a role for genomic approaches to better understanding and defining specific disease processes.	2009	Microarray and bioinformatics analysis of gene expression in experimental membranous nephropathy.	19390219	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC2459210	10.1371/journal.pbio.0060172	The glycosphingolipid isoglobotrihexosylceramide, or isogloboside 3 (iGb3), is believed to be critical for natural killer T (NKT) cell development and self-recognition in mice and humans. Furthermore, iGb3 may represent an important obstacle in xenotransplantation, in which this lipid represents the only other form of the major xenoepitope Galalpha(1,3)Gal. The role of iGb3 in NKT cell development is controversial, particularly with one study that suggested that NKT cell development is normal in mice that were rendered deficient for the enzyme iGb3 synthase (iGb3S). We demonstrate that spliced iGb3S mRNA was not detected after extensive analysis of human tissues, and furthermore, the iGb3S gene contains several mutations that render this product nonfunctional. We directly tested the potential functional activity of human iGb3S by expressing chimeric molecules containing the catalytic domain of human iGb3S. These hybrid molecules were unable to synthesize iGb3, due to at least one amino acid substitution. We also demonstrate that purified normal human anti-Gal immunoglobulin G can bind iGb3 lipid and mediate complement lysis of transfected human cells expressing iGb3. Collectively, our data suggest that iGb3S is not expressed in humans, and even if it were expressed, this enzyme would be inactive. Consequently, iGb3 is unlikely to represent a primary natural ligand for NKT cells in humans. Furthermore, the absence of iGb3 in humans implies that it is another source of foreign Galalpha(1,3)Gal xenoantigen, with obvious significance in the field of xenotransplantation.	2008	Humans lack iGb3 due to the absence of functional iGb3-synthase: implications for NKT cell development and transplantation.	18630988	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC5469214	10.1016/j.jpain.2014.09.010	<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Disorders of pain neural systems are frequently chronic and, when recalcitrant to treatment, can severely degrade the quality of life. The pain pathway begins with sensory neurons in dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia, and the neuronal subpopulations that express the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) ion channel transduce sensations of painful heat and inflammation and play a fundamental role in clinical pain arising from cancer and arthritis. In the present study, we elucidate the complete transcriptomes of neurons from the TRPV1 lineage and a non-TRPV1 neuroglial population in sensory ganglia through the combined application of next-gen deep RNA-Seq, genetic neuronal labeling with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, or neuron-selective chemoablation. RNA-Seq accurately quantitates gene expression, a difficult parameter to determine with most other methods, especially for very low and very high expressed genes. Differentially expressed genes are present at every level of cellular function from the nucleus to the plasma membrane. We identified many ligand receptor pairs in the TRPV1 population, suggesting that autonomous presynaptic regulation may be a major regulatory mechanism in nociceptive neurons. The data define, in a quantitative, cell population-specific fashion, the molecular signature of a distinct and clinically important group of pain-sensing neurons and provide an overall framework for understanding the transcriptome of TRPV1 nociceptive neurons.<h4>Perspective</h4>Next-gen RNA-Seq, combined with molecular genetics, provides a comprehensive and quantitative measurement of transcripts in TRPV1 lineage neurons and a contrasting transcriptome from non-TRPV1 neurons and cells. The transcriptome highlights previously unrecognized protein families, identifies multiple molecular circuits for excitatory or inhibitory autocrine and paracrine signaling, and suggests new combinatorial approaches to pain control.	2014	Molecular signatures of mouse TRPV1-lineage neurons revealed by RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis.	25281809	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
PMC3602116	10.1186/1471-2164-14-147	<h4>Background</h4>The meninges (arachnoid and pial membranes) and associated vasculature (MAV) and choroid plexus are important in maintaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generation and flow. MAV vasculature was previously observed to be adversely affected by environmentally-induced hyperthermia (EIH) and more so by a neurotoxic amphetamine (AMPH) exposure. Herein, microarray and RT-PCR analysis was used to compare the gene expression profiles between choroid plexus and MAV under control conditions and at 3 hours and 1 day after EIH or AMPH exposure. Since AMPH and EIH are so disruptive to vasculature, genes related to vasculature integrity and function were of interest.<h4>Results</h4>Our data shows that, under control conditions, many of the genes with relatively high expression in both the MAV and choroid plexus are also abundant in many epithelial tissues. These genes function in transport of water, ions, and solutes, and likely play a role in CSF regulation. Most genes that help form the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and tight junctions were also highly expressed in MAV but not in choroid plexus. In MAV, exposure to EIH and more so to AMPH decreased the expression of BBB-related genes such as Sox18, Ocln, and Cldn5, but they were much less affected in the choroid plexus. There was a correlation between the genes related to reactive oxidative stress and damage that were significantly altered in the MAV and choroid plexus after either EIH or AMPH. However, AMPH (at 3 hr) significantly affected about 5 times as many genes as EIH in the MAV, while in the choroid plexus EIH affected more genes than AMPH. Several unique genes that are not specifically related to vascular damage increased to a much greater extent after AMPH compared to EIH in the MAV (Lbp, Reg3a, Reg3b, Slc15a1, Sct and Fst) and choroid plexus (Bmp4, Dio2 and Lbp).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study indicates that the disruption of choroid plexus function and damage produced by AMPH and EIH is significant, but the changes may not be as pronounced as they are in the MAV, particularly for AMPH. Expression profiles in the MAV and choroid plexus differed to some extent and differences were not restricted to vascular related genes.	2013	Comparison of the global gene expression of choroid plexus and meninges and associated vasculature under control conditions and after pronounced hyperthermia or amphetamine toxicity.	23497014	A3GALT2	A3GALT2P	primary_symbol
NA	10.21203/rs.3.rs-2950284/v1	American Indians (AI) demonstrate the highest rates of both suicidal behaviors (SB) and alcohol use disorders (AUD) among all ethnic groups in the US. Rates of suicide and AUD vary substantially between tribal groups and across different geographical regions, underscoring a need to delineate more specific risk and resilience factors. Using data from over 740 AI living within eight contiguous reservations, we assessed genetic risk factors for SB by investigating: (1) possible genetic overlap with AUD, and (2) impacts of rare and low frequency genomic variants. Suicidal behaviors included lifetime history of suicidal thoughts and acts, including verified suicide deaths, scored using a ranking variable for the SB phenotype (range 0–4). We identified five loci significantly associated with SB and AUD, two of which are intergenic and three intronic on genes AACSP1 , ANK1 , and FBXO11 . Nonsynonymous rare mutations in four genes including SERPINF1 (PEDF), ZNF30 , CD34 , and SLC5A9 , and non-intronic rare mutations in genes OPRD1 , HSD17B3 and one lincRNA were significantly associated with SB. One identified pathway related to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) regulation, whose 83 nonsynonymous rare variants on 10 genes were significantly linked to SB as well. Four additional genes, and two pathways related to vasopressin-regulated water metabolism and cellular hexose transport, also were strongly associated with SB. This study represents the first investigation of genetic factors for SB in an American Indian population that has high risk for suicide. Our study suggests that bivariate association analysis between comorbid disorders can increase statistical power; and rare variant analysis in a high-risk population enabled by whole-genome sequencing has the potential to identify novel genetic factors. Although such findings may be population specific, rare functional mutations relating to PEDF and HIF regulation align with past reports and suggest a biological mechanism for suicide risk and a potential therapeutic target for intervention.	2023	Genetic Factors Associated with Suicidal Behaviors and Alcohol Use Disorders in an American Indian Population	NA	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol

PMC7723046	10.1038/s41598-020-67045-y	Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and endurance performance are characterized by a complex genetic trait with high heritability. Although research has identified many physiological and environmental correlates with CRF, the genetic architecture contributing to CRF remains unclear, especially in non-athlete population. A total of 762 Chinese young female participants were recruited and an endurance run test was used to determine CRF. We used a fixed model of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for CRF. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix Axiom and illumina 1 M arrays. After quality control and imputation, a linear regression-based association analysis was conducted using a total of 5,149,327 variants. Four loci associated with CRF were identified to reach genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), which located in 15q21.3 (rs17240160, P = 1.73 × 10<sup>-9</sup>, GCOM1), 3q25.31 (rs819865, P = 8.56 × 10<sup>-9</sup>, GMPS), 21q22.3 (rs117828698, P = 9.59 × 10<sup>-9</sup>, COL18A1), and 17q24.2 (rs79806428, P = 3.85 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, PRKCA).

PMC7862719	10.3389/fphys.2020.605792	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease that appeared at the end of 2019. As of July 2020, the cumulative number of infections and deaths have exceeded 15 million and 630,000, respectively. And new cases are increasing. There are still many difficulties surrounding research on the mechanism and development of therapeutic vaccines. It is urgent to explore the pathogenic mechanism of viruses to help prevent and treat COVID-19. In our study, we downloaded two datasets related to COVID-19 (GSE150819 and GSE147507). By analyzing the high-throughput expression matrix of uninfected human bronchial organoids and infected human bronchial organoids in the GSE150819, 456 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, which were mainly enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and so on. We also constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs to identify the hub genes. Then we analyzed GSE147507, which contained lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 and Calu3) and the primary bronchial epithelial cell line (NHBE), obtaining 799, 460, and 46 DEGs, respectively. The results showed that in human bronchial organoids, A549, Calu3, and NHBE samples infected with SARS-CoV-2, only one upregulated gene CSF3 was identified. Interestingly, CSF3 is one of the hub genes we previously screened in GSE150819, suggesting that CSF3 may be a potential drug target. Further, we screened potential drugs targeting CSF3 by MOE; the top 50 drugs were screened by flexible docking and rigid docking, with 37 intersections. Two antiviral drugs (Elbasvir and Ritonavir) were included; Elbasvir and Ritonavir formed van der Waals (VDW) interactions with surrounding residues to bind with CSF3, and Elbasvir and Ritonavir significantly inhibited CSF3 protein expression.	2020	CSF3 Is a Potential Drug Target for the Treatment of COVID-19.	33551833	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol

We constructed a prospective protein interaction network for ischemic stroke and inflammatory bowel disease, identifying cytokine and interleukin-related signaling pathways, Spliceosome, Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), Thrombus, and Anticoagulation pathways as the crucial biological mechanisms of the network. Furthermore, we also used data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) to detect differential protein expression in eight samples, which also suggested that immune system, signal transduction, and hemostasis-related pathways are key signaling pathways. These findings may provide a basis for understanding the interaction between these two states and exploring possible molecular and therapeutic studies in the future.	2023	Exploring the hub mechanisms of ischemic stroke based on protein-protein interaction networks related to ischemic stroke and inflammatory bowel disease. 	36720935	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol

However, the roles of the AS and TAPA in early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC) have not been revealed.<h4>Methods</h4>The global AS profiles of 80 EOGC patients were analyzed. The EOGC-specific AS events (ESASs) were identified in both the EOGC and adjacent non-tumor tissues. The functional enrichment analysis, Splicing network, Alternative Polyadenylation (APA) core factor network, and cell abundancy analysis were performed. Furthermore, the landscapes of the AS events in the varied subtypes of the EOGC patients were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 66,075 AS events and 267 ESASs were identified in the EOGC. Furthermore, 4809 genes and 6152 gene isoforms were found to be aberrantly expressed in the EOGC. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that the significant pathway alterations might exist in these AS events, genes, and gene isoforms. Moreover, the Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed that the UBC, NEK2, EPHB2, and DCTN1 genes were the hub genes in the AS events in the EOGC. The immune cell infiltration analysis indicated a correlation between the AS events and the cancer immune microenvironment. The distribution of the AS events in varied EOGC subtypes, protein phosphorylation and glycosylation was uneven.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study highlighted the vital roles of the AS in the EOGC, including modulating the specific protein modification and reshaping the cancer immune microenvironment, and yielded new insights into the diagnosis of the EOGC as well as cancer treatment.	2021	Identification of Novel Alternative Splicing Events Associated With Tumorigenesis, Protein Modification, and Immune Microenvironment in Early-Onset Gastric Cancer.	34168979	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC7194099	10.7717/peerj.8904	The sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene is an ubiquitous component in many plants that has commercially been used as an aroma in cosmetics and perfumes. Recent studies have shown its potential use as a therapeutic agent and biofuel. Currently, β-caryophyllene is isolated from large amounts of plant material. Molecular farming based on the Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression system may be used for a more sustainable production of β-caryophyllene. In this study, a full-length cDNA of a new duplicated β-caryophyllene synthase from Artemisia annua (AaCPS1) was isolated and functionally characterized. In order to produce β-caryophyllene in vitro, the AaCPS1 was cloned into a plant viral-based vector pEAQ-HT. Subsequently, the plasmid was transferred into the Agrobacterium and agroinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. The AaCPS1 expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR at different time points after agroinfiltration. The highest level of transcripts was observed at 9 days post infiltration (dpi). The AaCPS1 protein was extracted from the leaves at 9 dpi and purified by cobalt-nitrilotriacetate (Co-NTA) affinity chromatography using histidine tag with a yield of 89 mg kg-1 fresh weight of leaves. The protein expression of AaCPS1 was also confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot analyses. AaCPS1 protein uses farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as a substrate to produce β-caryophyllene. Product identification and determination of the activity of purified AaCPS1 were done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS results revealed that the AaCPS1 produced maximum 26.5 ± 1 mg of β-caryophyllene per kilogram fresh weight of leaves after assaying with FPP for 6 h. Using AaCPS1 as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that N. benthamiana can be considered as an expression system for production of plant proteins that catalyze the formation of valuable chemicals for industrial applications.	2020	Transient expression and purification of β-caryophyllene synthase in Nicotiana benthamiana to produce β-caryophyllene in vitro.	32377446	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC8948159	10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.01.014	Humans exhibit remarkable interindividual and interpopulation immune response variability upon microbial challenges. Cytokines play a vital role in regulating inflammation and immune responses, but dysregulation of cytokine responses has been implicated in different disease states. Host genetic factors were previously shown to significantly impact cytokine response heterogeneity mainly in European-based studies, but it is unclear whether these findings are transferable to non-European individuals. Here, we aimed to identify genetic variants modulating cytokine responses in healthy adults of East African ancestry from Tanzania. We leveraged both cytokine and genetic data and performed genome-wide cytokine quantitative trait loci (cQTLs) mapping. The results were compared with another cohort of healthy adults of Western European ancestry via direct overlap and functional enrichment analyses. We also performed meta-analyses to identify cQTLs with congruent effect direction in both populations. In the Tanzanians, cQTL mapping identified 80 independent suggestive loci and one genome-wide significant locus (TBC1D22A) at chromosome 22; SNP rs12169244 was associated with IL-1b release after Salmonella enteritidis stimulation. Remarkably, the identified cQTLs varied significantly when compared to the European cohort, and there was a very limited percentage of overlap (1.6% to 1.9%). We further observed ancestry-specific pathways regulating induced cytokine responses, and there was significant enrichment of the interferon pathway specifically in the Tanzanians. Furthermore, contrary to the Europeans, genetic variants in the TLR10-TLR1-TLR6 locus showed no effect on cytokine response. Our data reveal both ancestry-specific effects of genetic variants and pathways on cytokine response heterogeneity, hence arguing for the importance of initiatives to include diverse populations into genomics research.	2022	A functional genomics approach in Tanzanian population identifies distinct genetic regulators of cytokine production compared to European population.	35167808	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC7871559	10.1186/s13041-021-00743-4	Intelligence predicts important life and health outcomes, but the biological mechanisms underlying differences in intelligence are not yet understood. The use of genetically determined metabotypes (GDMs) to understand the role of genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions, in human complex traits has been recently proposed. However, this strategy has not been applied to human intelligence. Here we implemented a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using GDMs to assess the causal relationships between genetically determined metabolites and human intelligence. The standard inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used for the primary MR analysis and three additional MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO) were used for sensitivity analyses. Using 25 genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs), our study found that 5-oxoproline was associated with better performance in human intelligence tests (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 9.25 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). The causal relationship was robust when sensitivity analyses were applied (P<sub>MR-Egger</sub> = 0.0001, P<sub>Weighted median</sub> = 6.29 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, P<sub>MR-PRESSO</sub> = 0.0007), and repeated analysis yielded consistent result (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.0087). Similarly, also dihomo-linoleate (20:2n6) and p-acetamidophenylglucuronide showed robust association with intelligence. Our study provides novel insight by integrating genomics and metabolomics to estimate causal effects of genetically determined metabolites on human intelligence, which help to understanding of the biological mechanisms related to human intelligence.	2021	Causal relationships between genetically determined metabolites and human intelligence: a Mendelian randomization study.	33563321	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC8088053	10.1186/s12885-021-08211-x	<h4>Background</h4>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant head and neck tumor, and more than 70% of new cases are in East and Southeast Asia. However, association between NPC and pseudogenes playing important roles in genesis of multiple tumor types is still not clear and needs to be investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>Using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, we analyzed pseudogene expression in 13 primary NPC and 6 recurrent NPC samples as well as their paracancerous counterparts. Quantitative PCR was used to validate the differentially expressed pseudogenes.<h4>Results</h4>We found 251 differentially expressed pseudogenes including 73 up-regulated and 178 down-regulated ones between primary NPC and paracancerous tissues. Enrichment analysis of gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were conducted to filter out the key pseudogenes. We reported that pseudogenes from cytochrome P450 (CYP) family, such as CYP2F2P, CYP2G1P, CYP4F24P, CYP2B7P and CYP2G2P were significantly down-regulated in NPC compared to paracancerous tissues, while IGHV1OR15-2, IGHV3-11, FCGR1CP and IGHV3-69-1 belonging to Fc gamma receptors were significantly up-regulated. CYP2B7P, CYP2F2P and CYP4F26P were enriched in arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. The qRT-PCR analysis validated the lower expression of pseudogenes CYP2F2P and CYP2B7P in NPC tissues and cell lines compared to paracancerous tissues and normal human nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. CYP2B7P overexpression weakened migratory and invasive capacity of NPC cell line. Moreover, the expression pattern of those pseudogenes in recurrent NPC tissues was different from the primary NPC.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study suggested the role of pseudogenes in tumorigenesis and progression, potentially functioning as therapeutic targets to NPC.	2021	Identification of key pseudogenes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on RNA-Seq analysis.	33931030	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC5667849	10.1371/journal.pone.0187457	RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays are methods for measuring gene expression across the entire transcriptome. Recent advances have made these techniques practical and affordable for essentially any laboratory with experience in molecular biology. A variety of computational methods have been developed to decrease the amount of bioinformatics expertise necessary to analyze these data. Nevertheless, many barriers persist which discourage new labs from using functional genomics approaches. Since high-quality gene expression studies have enduring value as resources to the entire research community, it is of particular importance that small labs have the capacity to share their analyzed datasets with the research community. Here we introduce ExpressionDB, an open source platform for visualizing RNA-seq and microarray data accommodating virtually any number of different samples. ExpressionDB is based on Shiny, a customizable web application which allows data sharing locally and online with customizable code written in R. ExpressionDB allows intuitive searches based on gene symbols, descriptions, or gene ontology terms, and it includes tools for dynamically filtering results based on expression level, fold change, and false-discovery rates. Built-in visualization tools include heatmaps, volcano plots, and principal component analysis, ensuring streamlined and consistent visualization to all users. All of the scripts for building an ExpressionDB with user-supplied data are freely available on GitHub, and the Creative Commons license allows fully open customization by end-users. We estimate that a demo database can be created in under one hour with minimal programming experience, and that a new database with user-supplied expression data can be completed and online in less than one day.	2017	ExpressionDB: An open source platform for distributing genome-scale datasets.	29095940	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC6180637	10.1186/s12935-018-0652-6	<h4>Background</h4>Increasing evidence suggests a critical role for long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) and pseudogenes in cancer. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common primary renal neoplasm, is highly aggressive and difficult to treat because of its resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Despite many identified LncRNAs and pseudogenes, few have been clearly elucidated.<h4>Methods</h4>This study provides new insights into LncRNAs and pseudogenes in the prognosis of RCC. We searched an online database to interrogate alterations and clinical data on cBioPortal. We analysed LncRNA and pseudogene signatures to predict the prognosis of RCC based on a Cox model. We also found potential serum biomarkers of RCC and validated them in 32 RCC patients, as well as healthy controls.<h4>Results</h4>Alterations were found in 2553 LncRNAs and 8901 pseudogenes and occurred in up to 23% of all cases. Among these, 27 LncRNAs and 45 pseudogenes were closely related to prognosis. We also identified signatures of LncRNAs and pseudogenes that can predict overall survival and recurrence of RCC. We then validated the relative levels of these LncRNAs and pseudogenes in the serum of 32 patients. Six of these, including LINC00520, PIK3CD-AS1, LINC01559, CEACAM22P, MSL3P1 and TREML3P, could be non-invasive biomarkers of RCC. Finally, we selected PIK3CD-AS1 to determine its role in RCC and found that upregulation of PIK3CD-AS1 was closely associated with higher tumour stage and metastasis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These signatures of LncRNAs and pseudogenes can predict overall survival and recurrence of RCC. LINC00520, PIK3CD-AS1, LINC01559, CEACAM22P, MSL3P1 and TREML3P could be non-invasive biomarkers of RCC. These data suggest the important roles of LncRNAs and pseudogenes in RCC, and therefore provides us new insights into the prognosis of RCC.	2018	New insights into long noncoding RNAs and pseudogenes in prognosis of renal cell carcinoma.	30337839	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC6520385	10.1038/s41467-019-09511-4	Clinical applications of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are expected, but hiPSC lines vary in their differentiation propensity. For efficient selection of hiPSC lines suitable for differentiation into desired cell lineages, here we identify SALL3 as a marker to predict differentiation propensity. SALL3 expression in hiPSCs correlates positively with ectoderm differentiation capacity and negatively with mesoderm/endoderm differentiation capacity. Without affecting self-renewal of hiPSCs, SALL3 knockdown inhibits ectoderm differentiation and conversely enhances mesodermal/endodermal differentiation. Similarly, loss- and gain-of-function studies reveal that SALL3 inversely regulates the differentiation of hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes and neural cells. Mechanistically, SALL3 modulates DNMT3B function and DNA methyltransferase activity, and influences gene body methylation of Wnt signaling-related genes in hiPSCs. These findings suggest that SALL3 switches the differentiation propensity of hiPSCs toward distinct cell lineages by changing the epigenetic profile and serves as a marker for evaluating the hiPSC differentiation propensity.	2019	SALL3 expression balance underlies lineage biases in human induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation.	31092818	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC3627823	10.1007/s00439-013-1263-x	We describe a female subject (DGAP100) with a 46,X,t(X;5)(p11.3;q35.3)inv(5)(q35.3q35.1)dn, severe psychomotor retardation with hypotonia, global postnatal growth restriction, microcephaly, globally reduced cerebral volume, seizures, facial dysmorphia and cleft palate. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that the X chromosome breakpoint disrupts KDM6A in the second intron. No genes were directly disrupted on chromosome 5. KDM6A is a histone 3 lysine 27 demethylase and a histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase. Expression of KDM6A is significantly reduced in DGAP100 lymphoblastoid cells compared to control samples. We identified nine additional cases with neurodevelopmental delay and various other features consistent with the DGAP100 phenotype with copy number variation encompassing KDM6A from microarray databases. We evaluated haploinsufficiency of kdm6a in a zebrafish model. kdm6a is expressed in the pharyngeal arches and ethmoid plate of the developing zebrafish, while a kdm6a morpholino knockdown exhibited craniofacial defects. We conclude KDM6A dosage regulation is associated with severe and diverse structural defects and developmental abnormalities.	2013	Haploinsufficiency of KDM6A is associated with severe psychomotor retardation, global growth restriction, seizures and cleft palate.	23354975	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC6098161	10.1038/s41386-018-0117-6	An enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of depression would facilitate the discovery of new efficacious medications. To this end, we examined hippocampal transcriptional changes in rat models of disease and in humans to identify common disease signatures by using a new algorithm for signature-based clustering of expression profiles. The tool identified a transcriptomic signature comprising 70 probesets able to discriminate depression models from controls in both Flinders Sensitive Line and Learned Helplessness animals. To identify disease-relevant pathways, we constructed an expanded protein network based on signature gene products and performed functional annotation analysis. We applied the same workflow to transcriptomic profiles of depressed patients. Remarkably, a 171-probesets transcriptional signature which discriminated depressed from healthy subjects was identified. Rat and human signatures shared the SCARA5 gene, while the respective networks derived from protein-based significant interactions with signature genes contained 25 overlapping genes. The comparison between the most enriched pathways in the rat and human signature networks identified a highly significant overlap (p-value: 3.85 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) of 67 terms including ErbB, neurotrophin, FGF, IGF, and VEGF signaling, immune responses and insulin and leptin signaling. In conclusion, this study allowed the identification of a hippocampal transcriptional signature of resilient or susceptible responses in rat MDD models which overlapped with gene expression alterations observed in depressed patients. These findings are consistent with a loss of hippocampal neural plasticity mediated by altered levels of growth factors and increased inflammatory responses causing metabolic impairments as crucial factors in the pathophysiology of MDD.	2018	Cross-species evidence from human and rat brain transcriptome for growth factor signaling pathway dysregulation in major depression.	29950584	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC4063836	10.4161/epi.28153	Prenatal arsenic exposure is associated with increased risk of disease in adulthood. This has led to considerable interest in arsenic's ability to disrupt fetal programming. Many studies report that arsenic exposure alters DNA methylation in whole blood but these studies did not adjust for cell mixture. In this study, we examined the relationship between arsenic in maternal drinking water collected ≤ 16 weeks gestational age and DNA methylation in cord blood (n = 44) adjusting for leukocyte-tagged differentially methylated regions. DNA methylation was quantified using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip array. Recursively partitioned mixture modeling examined the relationship between arsenic and methylation at 473,844 CpG sites. Median arsenic concentration in water was 12 µg/L (range<1- 510 µg/L). Log 10 arsenic was associated with altered DNA methylation across the epigenome (P = 0.002); however, adjusting for leukocyte distributions attenuated this association (P = 0.013). We also observed that arsenic had a strong effect on the distribution of leukocytes in cord blood. In adjusted models, every log 10 increase in maternal drinking water arsenic exposure was estimated to increase CD8+ T cells by 7.4% (P = 0.0004) and decrease in CD4+ T cells by 9.2% (P = 0.0002). These results show that prenatal exposure to arsenic had an exposure-dependent effect on specific T cell subpopulations in cord blood and altered DNA methylation in cord blood. Future research is needed to determine if these small changes in DNA methylation alter gene expression or are associated with adverse health effects.	2014	Effect of prenatal arsenic exposure on DNA methylation and leukocyte subpopulations in cord blood.	24525453	AACSP1	AACSL	primary_symbol
PMC9922515	10.2147/dddt.s389764	<h4>Purpose</h4>Solanine is the main component of the plant Solanum, which has been shown to provide growth-limiting activities in a variety of human cancers. However, little is known about its function in gastric cancer (GC).<h4>Methods</h4>We investigated the effect of solanine on GC in vivo and in vitro. The inhibition rate of solanine on the tumor was observed by constructing a subcutaneous tumor in nude mice. Morphological changes were analyzed with H&E staining. The expression of ATF4 was detected by IF analysis. MTT assays, EdU staining, and colony formation assays were used to detect the inhibition rate of solanine on GC cells. Matrigel transwells were used to detect the invasion of GC cells. Cell migration was measured using the wound healing assay. The flow cytometric analysis was used to monitor changes in the cell cycle and cell apoptosis. Western blotting was used to detect major proteins in cells and tumors.<h4>Results</h4>Solanine suppressed gastric tumorigenesis. Solanine also inhibited the proliferation, invasion and mitigation of GC cells, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, the growth-limiting activities of solanine in gastric cancer were related to the suppression of the AAMDC/MYC/ATF4/Sesn2 pathway-mediated autophagy. Overexpression of AAMDC reversed the inhibitory effect of solanine on autophagy and gastric cancer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, our findings indicate that solanine confers growth-limiting activities by deactivating the AAMDC-regulated autophagy in gastric cancer.	2023	Solanine Represses Gastric Cancer Growth by Mediating Autophagy Through AAMDC/MYC/ATF4/Sesn2 Signaling Pathway.	36789094	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC7998036	10.1038/s41467-021-22101-7	Adipogenesis associated Mth938 domain containing (AAMDC) represents an uncharacterized oncogene amplified in aggressive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. We uncover that AAMDC regulates the expression of several metabolic enzymes involved in the one-carbon folate and methionine cycles, and lipid metabolism. We show that AAMDC controls PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, regulating the translation of ATF4 and MYC and modulating the transcriptional activity of AAMDC-dependent promoters. High AAMDC expression is associated with sensitization to dactolisib and everolimus, and these PI3K-mTOR inhibitors exhibit synergistic interactions with anti-estrogens in IntClust2 models. Ectopic AAMDC expression is sufficient to activate AKT signaling, resulting in estrogen-independent tumor growth. Thus, AAMDC-overexpressing tumors may be sensitive to PI3K-mTORC1 blockers in combination with anti-estrogens. Lastly, we provide evidence that AAMDC can interact with the RabGTPase-activating protein RabGAP1L, and that AAMDC, RabGAP1L, and Rab7a colocalize in endolysosomes. The discovery of the RabGAP1L-AAMDC assembly platform provides insights for the design of selective blockers to target malignancies having the AAMDC amplification.	2021	The oncogene AAMDC links PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling with metabolic reprograming in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.	33772001	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
NA	10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.07.313	<h4>Purpose/objective(s)</h4>As currently under investigation in PORTEC-4a, an integrated molecular model of endometrial cancer is postulated to risk stratify women to better identify those more likely to benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy following hysterectomy for early-stage disease. Stratification of tumor biology is based on several features, including: p53 mutation, POLE mutation, CTNNB1 mutation, microsatellite instability (MSI), LICAM expression and the presence of LVSI. TCGA data evaluating a large cohort of early and advanced stage endometrial tumors suggests that gene expression profiles may also distinguish between favorable and unfavorable biology of endometrial tumors. We aimed to determine whether recurrent early-stage endometrial tumors have distinct gene-expression patterns from early-stage tumors that did not recur.<h4>Materials/methods</h4>Using the TCGA-UCEC dataset available via the Genomic Data Commons, 394 Stage I-II tumors' gene expression data were evaluated and analyzed using R (R Core Team, 2020). Of these cases, 17 were confirmed as relapsed endometrial cancer (10 endometrioid and 7 serious/mixed) and 370 were tumors without documentation of a recurrence. Gene expression analysis was performed with limma, gene set variation analysis with GSVA, and gene enrichment with Metascape. The frequency of several common mutations was evaluated in the recurrent tumor subset.<h4>Results</h4>There were 860 differentially expressed genes in recurrent versus not recurrent early-stage tumors identified from the TCGA-UCEC dataset. The most significant of which include DDIT3, THAP12, EMSY, CLNS1A, and AAMDC (log[Fold Change] > 1000, adjusted P-value < 0.001). Differentially expressed genes show pathway enrichment in GO Biologic Processes and Reactome Gene Sets, specifically, mitochondrion organization, proteolysis, organelle disassembly, translation, response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, proteinases, cellular component disassembly, covalent chromatin modification, and intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. Non-overlapping mutations within the recurrent tumors include, 9 of 17 recurrent tumors with p53 mutation, 3 of 17 with CTNNB1 mutation, 4 of 17 with PIK3R1, PIK3CR and PIK3CB mutation, and 1 of 17 a mutation in POLE.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Of recurrent early-stage tumors within the TCGA-UCEC dataset, of which as least a majority classify as intermediate or unfavorable according to PORTEC-4a criteria, differential gene expression in recurrent tumors compared to not recurrent tumors demonstrate relative increased expression of genes involved in catabolic and cell cycle processes. PORTEC-4a does not employ gene expression signatures to distinguish amongst favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable subtypes of early-stage endometrial tumors. However, further investigation may prove gene expression incorporation into stratification beneficial.	2021	Gene Expression and Mutation Analysis of Early-Stage Recurrent Endometrial Cancer.	34700477	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9512962	10.1186/s12864-022-08888-9	<h4>Introduction</h4>Infectious diseases are common causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Susceptibility to infection is highly heritable; however, little has been done to identify the genetic determinants underlying common infectious diseases. One GWAS was performed using 23andMe information about self-reported infections; we set out to confirm previous loci and identify new ones using medically diagnosed infections.<h4>Methods</h4>We used the electronic health record (EHR)-based biobank at Vanderbilt and diagnosis codes to identify cases of 12 infectious diseases in white patients: urinary tract infection, pneumonia, chronic sinus infections, otitis media, candidiasis, streptococcal pharyngitis, herpes zoster, herpes labialis, hepatitis B, infectious mononucleosis, tuberculosis (TB) or a positive TB test, and hepatitis C. We selected controls from patients with no diagnosis code for the candidate disease and matched by year of birth, sex, and calendar year at first and last EHR visits. We conducted GWAS using SAIGE and transcriptome-wide analysis (TWAS) using S-PrediXcan. We also conducted phenome-wide association study to understand associations between identified genetic variants and clinical phenotypes.<h4>Results</h4>We replicated three 23andMe loci (p ≤ 0.05): herpes zoster and rs7047299-A (p = 2.6 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) and rs2808290-C (p = 9.6 × 10<sup>-3</sup>;); otitis media and rs114947103-C (p = 0.04). We also identified 2 novel regions (p ≤ 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>): rs113235453-G for otitis media (p = 3.04 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), and rs10422015-T for candidiasis (p = 3.11 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). In TWAS, four gene-disease associations were significant: SLC30A9 for otitis media (p = 8.06 × 10<sup>-7</sup>); LRP3 and WDR88 for candidiasis (p = 3.91 × 10<sup>-7</sup> and p = 1.95 × 10<sup>-6</sup>); and AAMDC for hepatitis B (p = 1.51 × 10<sup>-6</sup>).<h4>Conclusion</h4>We conducted GWAS and TWAS for 12 infectious diseases and identified novel genetic contributors to the susceptibility of infectious diseases.	2022	Genome-wide association analyses of common infections in a large practice-based biobank.	36167494	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

NA	10.1002/1873-3468.13449	The post-transcriptional events regulating expression of the adipogenesis associated Mth938 domain containing (AAMDC) protein are poorly understood. Here, we find that AAMDC expresses three isoforms due to alternative polyadenylation (APA) and alternative splicing (AS). Luciferase assay revealed that expression of the two isoforms with short and long 3'UTRs is differentially controlled. Further analyses showed that the short isoform displays higher translation efficiency and that miR-2428/664a reduces expression of the long isoform, indicating that APA-mediated shortening of the AAMDC 3'UTR renders the short isoform insusceptible to miRNA-mediated suppression due to loss of the binding sites for miR-2428/664a. Finally, we demonstrate that the short AAMDC isoform promotes bovine preadipocyte differentiation. Collectively, our findings indicate that AAMDC is post-transcriptionally regulated through APA and microRNAs.	2019	Adipogenesis associated Mth938 domain containing (AAMDC) protein expression is regulated by alternative polyadenylation and microRNAs.	31116411	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9014960	10.2147/ijgm.s360177	<h4>Introduction</h4>Amplification of the 11q13.3 locus has been observed in various tumors. This study sought to determine the correlation of gene amplification at the 11q13.3 locus with the immune status and survival of breast cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Amplification of the 11q13.3 locus was characterized by analyzing a publicly available database from the cBioPortal platform (TCGA). The correlation of amplified genes with immune cell infiltration in breast cancer was further analyzed using the TIMER2.0 platform. Immunohistochemical staining was used to determine the expression levels of Cyclin D1 (CCND1), Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and P53 in 156 clinical breast cancer samples.<h4>Results</h4>This study revealed that amplification of the 11q13.3 amplicon in breast cancer is likely more frequently detected in luminal B breast cancer. Moreover, high expression or amplification of <i>CCND1</i>, fibroblast growth factor 3 (<i>FGF3</i>), fibroblast growth factor 4 (<i>FGF4</i>), fibroblast growth factor 19 (<i>FGF19</i>) and <i>FADD</i> was inversely correlated with the abundance of CD4+ T cells and dendritic cell infiltration in breast cancer (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Data analysis also demonstrated that high expression of <i>CCND1, FGF4</i> and <i>FADD</i> mRNA levels was closely correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with breast cancer (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The results of immunohistochemical staining from clinical samples further confirmed that high expression of CCND1 and FADD was frequently detected in luminal B and high-grade breast cancer with shorter metastasis-free survival times (<i>P</i> < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study demonstrated that coamplification of genes located on the 11q13.3 amplicon is frequently detected in luminal B subtype breast cancer and is closely associated with worse survival in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, coamplification of the <i>CCND1-FGF</i> locus might decrease antitumor immune activity in breast cancer, indicating that coamplification of the 11q13.3 amplicon is likely to be a key determinant of therapeutic resistance and accelerate the aggressive evolution of breast cancer.	2022	Clinical Impact of 11q13.3 Amplification on Immune Cell Infiltration and Prognosis in Breast Cancer.	35444456	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9748644	10.3892/etm.2022.11728	Esophageal cancer has high incidence rate in China. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) has become the standard treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, there are few reliable epigenetic parameters for patients with ESCC undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Genomic extract from tumor tissue was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq4000 to quantify genes associated methylation or hydromethylation in 12 patients with ESCC undergoing nCRT. The genome-wide hydroxymethylation were analyzed by methylated and hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing by MACS2 software and UCSC RefSeq database. Abnormal DNA methylation was statistically different between nCRT-well (showed a pathological complete response to nCRT) and nCRT-poor (showed incomplete pathological response to nCRT) patients. Levels of ten-eleven translocation 1, 2 and 3 mRNA and protein were higher in tumor tissue in nCRT-well group patients than in nCRT-poor group patients. Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing identified 2925 hypo-differentially hydroxymethylated region (DhMRs) and 292 hyper-DhMRs in promoter between nCRT-well and nCRT-poor patients. Biological processes associated with hyper-DhMRs included 'snRNA processing', 'hormone-mediated signaling pathway' and 'cellular response'. Metabolic processes were associated with hypo-DhMRs. These data may explain the functional response to nCRT in patients with abnormal promoter of methylation gene-associated mRNA expression. The present results implied that hyper-DhMRs and hypo-DhMRs affect molecular pathways, such as hippo and Notch signaling pathways, highlighting epigenetic modifications associated with clinical response to nCRT in patients with esophageal cancer.	2023	Altered genome‑wide hydroxymethylation analysis for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in esophageal cancer.	36561617	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6109977	10.1186/s40104-018-0280-y	<h4>Background</h4>The high mortality of pre-weanling piglets is a dominant challenge which severely restricts the development of pig industry. A number of factors including nutrients imbalance and temperature variation during postnatal period of piglets have been reported to closely associated with the high mortality of postnatal piglets. This study aims to find out the relationship between fat deposition and survival of newborn piglets.<h4>Results</h4>There were no differences in organ coefficient and bone density between the surviving and dead piglets (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The body weight and the fat deposition in the dead piglets were lower than the live individuals (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Consistently, the average sizes of white adipocytes in back and abdominal adipose tissues of dead piglets were smaller than the survivals (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The protein expression levels of adipocyte differentiation markers PPARγ and C/EBPα in the back and abdominal adipose tissues were lower in dead piglets compared to live piglets. The mRNA expressions of thermogenic markers <i>PGC1α</i> and <i>PRDM16</i> in adipose tissues were decreased in the dead piglets (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The microarray of back fat samples from the surviving and dead piglets were conducted; two down-regulated genes namely <i>AAMDC</i> and <i>CASTOR1</i> were identified from the dead piglets. According to quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, the mRNA expression of <i>AAMDC</i> decreased, whereas <i>CASTOR1</i> expression elevated in the dead piglets compared to the surviving piglets (<i>P</i> < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The fat deposition and adipocyte differentiation in the dead piglets are insufficient compared to the surviving piglets, which may attenuate the thermogenic ability of white adipose tissue (WAT). Our data indicate that fat deposition in newborn piglets is vital to their survival.	2018	Fat deposition deficiency is critical for the high mortality of pre-weanling newborn piglets.	30155244	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC10148390	10.1186/s12953-023-00208-7	<h4>Objective</h4>We investigated differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in human glioblastoma U87 cells after treatment with hederagenin as a therapeutic screening mechanism and provided a theoretical basis for hederagenin in treating glioblastoma.<h4>Methods</h4>The Cell Counting Kit 8 assay was used to analyze the inhibitory effect of hederagenin on the proliferation of U87 cells. Protein was identified by tandem mass tags and LC-MS/MS analysis techniques. Annotation of DEPs, Gene Ontology enrichment and function, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and domains were all examined by bioinformatics. According to the TMT results, hub protein was selected from DEPs for WB verification.<h4>Results</h4>Protein quantitative analysis found 6522 proteins in total. Compared with the control group, 43 DEPs (P < 0.05) were involved in the highly enriched signaling pathway in the hederagenin group, among which 20 proteins were upregulated, and 23 proteins were downregulated. These different proteins are mainly involved in the longness regulating pathway-WORM, the hedgehog signaling pathway, Staphylococcus aureus infection, complement, coagulation cascades, and mineral absorption. KIF7 and ATAD2B expression were significantly down-regulated and PHEX and TIMM9 expression were significantly upregulated, according to WB analysis, supporting the TMT findings.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Hederagenin inhibition of GBM U87 cells may be related to KIF7, which is mainly involved in the hedgehog signaling pathway. Our findings lay a foundation for additional study of the therapeutic mechanism of hederagenin.	2023	Proteomics identifies differentially expressed proteins in glioblastoma U87 cells treated with hederagenin.	37120556	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9339312	10.1093/g3journal/jkac133	Migration is a complex phenotypic trait with some species containing migratory and nonmigratory individuals. Such life history variation may be attributed in part to plasticity, epigenetics, or genetics. Although considered semianadromous, recent studies using otolith geochemistry have revealed life history variation within the critically endangered Delta Smelt. Broadly categorizable as migratory or freshwater residents, we examined Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing data to test for a relationship between genetic variation and migratory behaviors. As previously shown, we found no evidence for neutral population genetic structure within Delta Smelt; however, we found significant evidence for associations between genetic variants and life history phenotypes. Furthermore, discriminant analysis of principal components, hierarchical clustering, and machine learning resulted in accurate assignment of fish into the freshwater resident or migratory classes based on their genotypes. These results suggest the presence of adaptive genetic variants relating to life history variation within a panmictic population. Mechanisms that may lead to this observation are genotype dependent habitat choice and spatially variable selection, both of which could operate each generation and are not exclusive. Given that the population of cultured Delta Smelt are being used as a refugial population for conservation, as a supply for wild population supplementation, and currently represent the majority of all living individuals of this species, we recommend that the hatchery management strategy consider the frequencies of life history-associated alleles and how to maintain this important aspect of Delta Smelt biological variation while under captive propagation.	2022	Polygenic discrimination of migratory phenotypes in an estuarine forage fish.	35640553	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9954687	10.3390/cancers15041303	The current molecular classification divides breast cancer into four major subtypes, including luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and basal-like, based on receptor gene expression profiling. Luminal A and luminal B are hormone receptor (HR, estrogen, and/or progesterone receptor)-positive and are the most common subtypes, accounting for around 50-60% and 15-20% of the total breast cancer cases, respectively. The drug treatment for HR-positive breast cancer includes endocrine therapy, HER2-targeted therapy (depending on the HER2 status), and chemotherapy (depending on the risk of recurrence). In this review, in addition to classification, we focused on discussing the important aspects of HR-positive breast cancer, including HR structure and signaling, genetics, including epigenetics and gene mutations, gene expression-based assays, the traditional and new drugs for treatment, and novel or new uses of technology in diagnosis and treatment. Particularly, we have summarized the commonly mutated genes and abnormally methylated genes in HR-positive breast cancer and compared four common gene expression-based assays that are used in breast cancer as prognostic and/or predictive tools in detail, including their clinical use, the factors being evaluated, patient demographics, and the scoring systems. All these topic discussions have not been fully described and summarized within other research or review articles.	2023	Genetics, Treatment, and New Technologies of Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.	36831644	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9539456	10.1083/jcb.202201114	Rab5 and Rab7 are known to regulate endosome maturation, and a Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion mediated by a Rab7 activator, Mon1-Ccz1, is essential for progression of the maturation process. However, the importance and mechanism of Rab5 inactivation during endosome maturation are poorly understood. Here, we report a novel Rab5-GAP, TBC1D18, which is associated with Mon1 and mediates endosome maturation. We found that increased active Rab5 (Rab5 hyperactivation) in addition to reduced active Rab7 (Rab7 inactivation) occurs in the absence of Mon1. We present evidence showing that the severe defects in endosome maturation in Mon1-KO cells are attributable to Rab5 hyperactivation rather than to Rab7 inactivation. We then identified TBC1D18 as a Rab5-GAP by comprehensive screening of TBC-domain-containing Rab-GAPs. Expression of TBC1D18 in Mon1-KO cells rescued the defects in endosome maturation, whereas its depletion attenuated endosome formation and degradation of endocytosed cargos. Moreover, TBC1D18 was found to be associated with Mon1, and it localized in close proximity to lysosomes in a Mon1-dependent manner.	2022	TBC1D18 is a Rab5-GAP that coordinates endosome maturation together with Mon1.	36197338	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC8750459	10.3390/cells11010172	Teneurin 4 (TENM4) is a transmembrane protein that is codified by the ODZ4 gene and is involved in nervous system development, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal differentiation. In line with its involvement in the nervous system, TENM4 has also been implicated in several mental disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. TENM4 mutations and rearrangements have recently been identified in a number of tumors. This, combined with impaired expression in tumors, suggests that it may potentially be involved in tumorigenesis. Most of the TENM4 mutations that are observed in tumors occur in breast cancer, in which TENM4 plays a role in cells' migration and stemness. However, the functional role that TENM4 plays in breast cancer still needs to be better evaluated, and further studies are required to better understand the involvement of TENM4 in breast cancer progression. Herein, we review the currently available data for TENM4's role in breast cancer and propose its use as both a novel target with which to ameliorate patient prognosis and as a potential biomarker. Moreover, we also report data on the tumorigenic role of miR-708 deregulation and the possible use of this miRNA as a novel therapeutic molecule, as miR-708 is spliced out from TENM4 mRNA.	2022	Role and Involvement of TENM4 and miR-708 in Breast Cancer Development and Therapy. 	35011736	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

Although tumor mutation burden is associated with improved treatment response, the mutation frequency in expressed genes is superior in predicting outcome. Increased T cell density in baseline tumors and dynamic changes in regression or expansion of the T cell repertoire during therapy distinguish responders from non-responders. Transcriptome analyses reveal an increased abundance of B cell subsets in tumors from responders and patterns of molecular response related to expressed mutation elimination or retention that reflect clinical outcome. High-dimensional genomic, transcriptomic, and immune repertoire data were integrated into a multi-modal predictor of response. These findings identify genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of tumors and immune cells that predict response to immune checkpoint blockade and highlight the importance of pre-existing T and B cell immunity in therapeutic outcomes.	2020	Integrative Tumor and Immune Cell Multi-omic Analyses Predict Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Melanoma.	33294860	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

The present study attempted to visualize the prognostic landscape of MT functional isoforms and identify potential prognostic biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). <b>Methods:</b> The transcriptional expression, comprehensive prognostic performances, and gene-gene interaction network of MT isoforms in HCC were evaluated <i>via</i> Oncomine, GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier plotter, and GeneMANIA databases. Characterized by good prognostic value in three external cohorts, <i>MT1H</i> was specifically selected as a potential prognostic biomarker in HCC with various clinicopathological features. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of <i>MT1H</i> status were performed using cBioPortal, the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), and ssGSVA method. <b>Results:</b> <i>MT1E/1F/1G/1H/1M/1X/2A</i> was greatly downregulated in HCC. Prognostic analyses elucidated the essential correlations between <i>MT1A/1B/1H/1X/2A/4</i> attenuation and poor overall survival, between <i>MT1B/1H/4</i> downregulation and worse relapse-free survival, and between <i>MT1A/1B/1E/1H/1M/2A/4</i> downregulation and diminished progression-free survival in HCC. Taken together, these results indicated the powerful prognostic value of <i>MT1H</i> among MTs in HCC. In-depth analyses suggested that <i>MT1H</i> may be more applicable to alcohol-derived HCC and involved in the downregulation of the inflammatory pathway, Jak-STAT pathway, TNF pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway. <b>Conclusion:</b> MT-specific isoforms displayed aberrant expression and varying prognostic value in HCC. <i>MT1H</i> repression in HCC was multi-dimensionally detrimental to patient outcomes. Therefore, <i>MT1H</i> was possibly associated with carcinogenesis and exploited as a novel prognostic biomarker and candidate therapeutic target for HCC.	2021	Integrative Analysis of Metallothioneins Identifies MT1H as Candidate Prognostic Biomarker in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	34676244	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC7873252	10.1038/s41392-020-00412-3	Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of the gallbladder (GB-NEC) is a rare but extremely malignant subtype of gallbladder cancer (GBC). The genetic and molecular signatures of GB-NEC are poorly understood; thus, molecular targeting is currently unavailable. In the present study, we applied whole-exome sequencing (WES) technology to detect gene mutations and predicted somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 15 cases of GB-NEC and 22 cases of general GBC. In 15 GB-NECs, the C > T mutation was predominant among the 6 types of SNVs. TP53 showed the highest mutation frequency (73%, 11/15). Compared with neuroendocrine carcinomas of other organs, significantly mutated genes (SMGs) in GB-NECs were more similar to those in pulmonary large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs), with driver roles for TP53 and RB1. In the COSMIC database of cancer-related genes, 211 genes were mutated. Strikingly, RB1 (4/15, 27%) and NAB2 (3/15, 20%) mutations were found specifically in GB-NECs; in contrast, mutations in 29 genes, including ERBB2 and ERBB3, were identified exclusively in GBC. Mutations in RB1 and NAB2 were significantly related to downregulation of the RB1 and NAB2 proteins, respectively, according to immunohistochemical (IHC) data (p values = 0.0453 and 0.0303). Clinically actionable genes indicated 23 mutated genes, including ALK, BRCA1, and BRCA2. In addition, potential somatic SNVs predicted by ISOWN and SomVarIUS constituted 6 primary COSMIC mutation signatures (1, 3, 30, 6, 7, and 13) in GB-NEC. Genes carrying somatic SNVs were enriched mainly in oncogenic signaling pathways involving the Notch, WNT, Hippo, and RTK-RAS pathways. In summary, we have systematically identified the mutation landscape of GB-NEC, and these findings may provide mechanistic insights into the specific pathogenesis of this deadly disease.	2021	Whole-exome mutational landscape of neuroendocrine carcinomas of the gallbladder.	33563892	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9569446	10.3390/ijms231911516	N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification of RNA in eukaryotic cells, and, in recent years, it has gained increasing attention. A good amount of data support the involvement of m6A modification in tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and metastatic dissemination. However, the role of this RNA modification in thyroid cancer still remains poorly investigated. In this study, m6A-related RNA methylation profiles are compared between a normal thyroid cell line and different thyroid cancer cell lines. With this approach, it was possible to identify the different patterns of m6A modification in different thyroid cancer models. Furthermore, by silencing METTL3, which is the main player in the RNA methylation machinery, it was possible to evaluate the impact of m6A modification on gene expression in an anaplastic thyroid cancer model. This experimental approach allowed us to identify <i>DDI2</i> as a gene specifically controlled by the m6A modification in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines. Altogether, these data are a proof of concept that RNA methylation widely occurs in thyroid cancer cell models and open a way forward in the search for new molecular patterns for diagnostic discrimination between benign and malignant lesions.	2022	Role of m6A RNA Methylation in Thyroid Cancer Cell Lines.	36232810	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC8615635	10.3390/biomedicines9111560	This paper concerns 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of mRNAs, which are non-coding regulatory platforms that control stability, fate and the correct spatiotemporal translation of mRNAs. Many mRNAs have polymorphic 3'UTR regions. Controlling 3'UTR length and sequence facilitates the regulation of the accessibility of functional effectors (RNA binding proteins, miRNAs or other ncRNAs) to 3'UTR functional boxes and motifs and the establishment of different regulatory landscapes for mRNA function. In this context, shortening of 3'UTRs would loosen miRNA or protein-based mechanisms of mRNA degradation, while 3'UTR lengthening would strengthen accessibility to these effectors. Alterations in the mechanisms regulating 3'UTR length would result in widespread deregulation of gene expression that could eventually lead to diseases likely linked to the loss (or acquisition) of specific miRNA binding sites. Here, we will review the mechanisms that control 3'UTR length dynamics and their alterations in human disorders. We will discuss, from a mechanistic point of view centered on the molecular machineries involved, the generation of 3'UTR variability by the use of alternative polyadenylation and cleavage sites, of mutually exclusive terminal alternative exons (exon skipping) as well as by the process of exonization of Alu cassettes to generate new 3'UTRs with differential functional features.	2021	Dynamic Variations of 3'UTR Length Reprogram the mRNA Regulatory Landscape. 	34829789	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

The mRNAs-miRNAs-lncRNAs regulatory network involved in NAFLD was retrieved and constructed utilizing bioinformatics tools. Then, we validated this network using an NAFLD animal model, high sucrose and high fat diet (HSHF)-fed rats. Finally, the expression level of the network players was assessed in the liver tissues using reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction. in-silico constructed network revealed six mRNAs (YAP1, FOXA2, AMOTL2, TEAD2, SMAD4 and NF2), two miRNAs (miR-650 and miR-1205), and two lncRNAs (RPARP-AS1 and SRD5A3-AS1) that play important roles as a co-regulatory network in NAFLD pathogenesis. Moreover, the expression level of these constructed network-players was significantly different between NAFLD and normal control.

To identify proteins acquiring a distinct phosphorylation status, herein, we compared the phosphorylation profile of macrophages upon exposure to Mtb and BCG. We observed a significant dephosphorylation of proteins following Mtb infection relative to those with uninfected or BCG-infected cells. A comprehensive tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (MS) approach detected ∼10% phosphosites on a variety of host proteins that are modulated in response to infection. Interestingly, the innate immune-enhancing interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes were identified as a class of proteins differentially phosphorylated during infection, including the cytosolic RNA sensor RIG-I, which has been implicated in the immune response to bacterial infection. We show that Mtb infection results in the activation of RIG-I in primary human macrophages. Studies using RIG-I knockout macrophages reveal that the Mtb-mediated activation of RIG-I promotes IFN-β, IL-1α, and IL-1β levels, dampens autophagy, and facilitates intracellular Mtb survival. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing exhaustive information on relative and quantitative changes in the global phosphoproteome profile of host macrophages that can be further explored in designing novel anti-TB drug targets.

We hypothesized that such genes would play a role in metabolism. Ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1), a gene which plays a role in mitochondrial fission and peroxisomal function in neuronal cells but whose function in skeletal muscle is undescribed, was identified and further validated. AMPK activation reduced GDAP1 expression in skeletal muscle. GDAP1 expression was elevated in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic patients but decreased after acute exercise.<h4>Methods</h4>The metabolic impact of GDAP1 silencing was determined in primary skeletal muscle cells via siRNA-transfections. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize whether silencing GDAP1 impacted mitochondrial network morphology and membrane potential.<h4>Results</h4>GDAP1 silencing increased mitochondrial protein abundance, decreased palmitate oxidation, and decreased non-mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondrial morphology was unaltered by GDAP1 silencing. GDAP1 silencing and treatment of cells with AMPK agonists altered several genes in the core molecular clock machinery.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We describe a role for GDAP1 in regulating mitochondrial proteins, circadian genes, and metabolic flux in skeletal muscle.

PMC10030835	10.3389/fmed.2023.1086756	Alport syndrome (AS) is an inherited glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). X-linked AS (XLAS) is caused by pathogenic variants in the <i>COL4A5</i> gene. Many pathogenic variants causing AS have been detected, but the genetic modifications and pathological alterations leading to ESRD have not been fully characterized. In this study, a novel frameshift variant c.980_983del ATGG in the exon 17 of the <i>COL4A5</i> gene detected in a patient with XLAS was introduced into a mouse model in by CRISPR/Cas9 system. Through biochemical urinalysis, histopathology, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) detection, the clinical manifestations and pathological alterations of Del-ATGG mice were characterized. From 16 weeks of age, obvious proteinuria was observed and TEM showed typical alterations of XLAS. The pathological changes included glomerular atrophy, increased monocytes in renal interstitial, and the absence of type IV collagen α5. The expression of <i>Col4a5</i> was significantly decreased in Del-ATGG mouse model. Transcriptomic analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) accounted for 17.45% (4,188/24003) of all genes. GO terms indicated that the functions of identified DEGs were associated with cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, while KEGG terms found enhanced the degradation of ECM, amino acid metabolism, helper T-cell differentiation, various receptor interactions, and several important pathways such as chemokine signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In conclusion, a mouse model with a frameshift variant in the <i>Col4a5 gene</i> has been generated to demonstrate the biochemical, histological, and pathogenic alterations related to AS. Further gene expression profiling and transcriptomic analysis revealed DEGs and enriched pathways potentially related to the disease progression of AS.

PMC6553502	10.1093/gbe/evz090	"Meiotic recombination is a highly conserved process that has profound effects on genome evolution. At a fine-scale, recombination rates can vary drastically across genomes, often localized into small recombination ""hotspots"" with highly elevated rates, surrounded by regions with little recombination. In most species studied, the location of hotspots within genomes is highly conserved across broad evolutionary timescales. The main exception to this pattern is in mammals, where hotspot location can evolve rapidly among closely related species and even among populations within a species. Hotspot position in mammals is controlled by the gene, Prdm9, whereas in species with conserved hotspots, a functional Prdm9 is typically absent. Due to a limited number of species where recombination rates have been estimated at a fine-scale, it remains unclear whether hotspot conservation is always associated with the absence of a functional Prdm9. Threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are an excellent model to examine the evolution of recombination over short evolutionary timescales. Using a linkage disequilibrium-based approach, we found recombination rates indeed varied at a fine-scale across the genome, with many regions organized into narrow hotspots. Hotspots had highly divergent landscapes between stickleback populations, where only ∼15% of these hotspots were shared. Our results indicate that fine-scale recombination rates may be diverging between closely related populations of threespine stickleback fish. Interestingly, we found only a weak association of a PRDM9 binding motif within hotspots, which suggests that threespine stickleback fish may possess a novel mechanism for targeting recombination hotspots at a fine-scale."	2019	Divergent Fine-Scale Recombination Landscapes between a Freshwater and Marine Population of Threespine Stickleback Fish.	31028697	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC7563548	10.3390/genes11091067	Heat stress results in reduced productivity, anorexia, and mortality in chickens. The objective of the study was to identify genes and signal pathways associated with heat stress and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in the liver of chickens through RNA-seq analysis, using two highly inbred chicken lines (Leghorn and Fayoumi). All birds were held in the same environment until 14 days of age. On day 14, half the birds were exposed to 38 °C with 50% relative humidity for 4 h, then 35 °C until the end of the experiment. The remaining birds were kept at 25 °C throughout the experiment. The heat-treated birds were inoculated at 21 days of age with 107 EID50 (One EID50 unit is the amount of virus that will infect 50 percent of inoculated embryos) NDV La Sota strain to investigate the effects of both heat stress and NDV infection. Physiological parameters were recorded as blood phenotypes at three stages: acute heat (AH), chronic heat (CH1), and chronic heat combined with NDV infection (CH&NDV), at 4 h, 7 days, and 10 days post-initiation of heat treatment, respectively. Our previous work revealed that the heat-resilient Fayoumi line maintained a more stable acid-base balance in their blood compared to the Leghorn line. Liver samples were harvested on both AH and CH&NDV to characterize the transcriptome profiles of these two inbred lines. Both genetic lines and treatments had large impact on the liver transcriptome. Fayoumi birds had more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than Leghorn birds for both treatments. Metabolic and immune-related genes were on the DEG list, with Fayoumi having more immune-related DEGs than Leghorns, which was confirmed by gene functional enrichment analysis. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) indicated that the driver genes such as Solute Carrier Family genes could be very important for stabilizing the acid-base balance in Fayoumi birds during heat stress. Therefore, candidate genes such solute carrier family genes could be potential genetic targets that are regulated by Fayoumis to maintain physical hemostasis under heat stress. Differential gene expression showed that Leghorns mainly performed metabolic regulation in response to heat stress and NDV infection, while Fayoumis regulated both immune and metabolic functions.

Here, we investigated metabolic features of amyloid precursor protein overexpressing APP23 female mice modeling AD upon long-term challenge with high-sucrose (HSD) or high-fat diet (HFD). Compared to wild type littermates (WT), APP23 females were less prone to mild HSD-induced and considerable HFD-induced glucose tolerance deterioration, despite unaltered glucose tolerance during normal-control diet. Indirect calorimetry revealed increased energy expenditure and hyperactivity in APP23 females. Dietary interventions, especially HFD, had weaker effects on lean and fat mass gain, steatosis and adipocyte hypertrophy of APP23 than WT mice, as shown by <sup>1</sup>H-magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy, histological and biochemical analyses. Proteome analysis revealed differentially regulated expression of mitochondrial proteins in APP23 livers and brains. In conclusion, hyperactivity, increased metabolic rate, and global mitochondrial dysfunction potentially add up to the development of AD-related body weight changes in APP23 females, becoming especially evident during diet-induced metabolic challenge. These findings emphasize the importance of translating this metabolic phenotyping into human research to decode the metabolic component in AD pathogenesis.	2021	Dietary-challenged mice with Alzheimer-like pathology show increased energy expenditure and reduced adipocyte hypertrophy and steatosis.	33864446	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC7226486	10.3390/cancers12040841	The discoidin domain receptor-1 (DDR1) is a non-integrin collagen receptor recently implicated in the collective cell migration of other cancer types. Previously, we identified an elevated expression of DDR1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Through the data mining of a microarray dataset composed of matched tumor-normal tissues from forty OSCC patients, we distilled overexpressed genes statistically associated with angiolymphatic invasion, including DDR1, COL4A5, COL4A6 and PDPN. Dual immunohistochemical staining further confirmed the spatial locations of DDR1 and PDPN in OSCC tissues indicative of collective cancer cell invasion. An elevated DDR1 expression at both the transcription and protein level was observed by treating keratinocytes with collagen of fibrillar or basement membrane types. In addition, inhibition of DDR1 kinase activity in OSCC TW2.6 cells disrupted cell cohesiveness in a 2D culture, reduced spheroid invasion in a collagen gel matrix, and suppressed angiolymphatic invasion in xenograft tissues. Taken together, these results suggest that collagen deposition in the affected tissues followed by DDR1 overexpression could be central to OSCC tumor growth and angiolymphatic invasion. Thus, DDR1 inhibitors are potential therapeutic compounds in restraining oral cancer, which has not been previously explored.	2020	Discoidin Domain Receptor-1 (DDR1) is Involved in Angiolymphatic Invasion in Oral Cancer. 	32244515	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6359977	10.1158/1541-7786.mcr-18-0946	DNA sequencing has identified a limited number of driver mutations in metastatic breast cancer beyond single base-pair mutations in the estrogen receptor (<i>ESR1</i>). However, our previous studies and others have observed that structural variants, such as ESR1 fusions, may also play a role. Therefore, we expanded upon these observations by performing a comprehensive and highly sensitive characterization of copy-number (CN) alterations in a large clinical cohort of metastatic specimens. NanoString DNA hybridization was utilized to measure CN gains, amplifications, and deletions of 67 genes in 108 breast cancer metastases, and in 26 cases, the patient-matched primary tumor. For ESR1, a copyshift algorithm was applied to identify CN imbalances at exon-specific resolution and queried large data sets (>15,000 tumors) that had previously undergone next-generation sequencing (NGS). Interestingly, a subset of ER<sup>+</sup> tumors showed increased ESR1 CN (11/82, 13%); three had CN amplifications (4%) and eight had gains (10%). Increased <i>ESR1</i> CN was enriched in metastatic specimens versus primary tumors, and this was orthogonally confirmed in a large NGS data set. <i>ESR1</i>-amplified tumors showed a site-specific enrichment for bone metastases and worse outcomes than nonamplified tumors. No <i>ESR1</i> CN amplifications and only one gain was identified in ER<sup>-</sup> tumors. <i>ESR1</i> copyshift was present in 5 of the 11 ESR1-amplified tumors. Other frequent amplifications included <i>ERBB2, GRB7</i>, and cell-cycle pathway members <i>CCND1</i> and <i>CDK4/6</i>, which showed mutually exclusivity with deletions of <i>CDKN2A, CDKN2B</i>, and <i>CDKN1B</i>. IMPLICATIONS: Copy-number alterations of <i>ESR1</i> and key CDK pathway genes are frequent in metastatic breast cancers, and their clinical relevance should be tested further.	2019	Frequent ESR1 and CDK Pathway Copy-Number Alterations in Metastatic Breast Cancer.	30355675	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6662468	10.1155/2019/2957821	<h4>Background</h4>Metallothioneins (MTs) family comprises many isoforms, most of which are frequently dysregulated in a wide range of cancers. However, the expression pattern and exact role of each distinct MT family isoform which contributes to tumorigenesis, progression, and drug resistance of gastric cancer (GC) are still unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>Publicly available databases including Oncomine, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Kaplan-Meier plotter, SurvExpress, MethHC, cBioportal, and GeneMANIA were accessed to perform an integrated bioinformatic analysis and try to detect fundamental relationships between each MT family member and GC.<h4>Results</h4>Bioinformatic data indicated that the mRNA expression of all MT family members was almost lowly expressed in GC compared with normal gastric tissue (P<0.05), and patients with reduced mRNA expression of each individual MT member had inconsistent prognostic value (OS, FP, PPS), which depended on the individual isoform of MT. A negative correlation between the methylation in promoter region of majority of MT members and their mRNA expression was detected from MethHC database (p<0.001). Data downloaded from TCGA revealed that MTs were rarely mutated in GC patients and MT2A was frequently regulated by other three genes (FOS, JUN, SP1) in GC patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MTs were nearly downregulated, and distinct type of MT harbored different prognostic role in GC patients. Methylation in gene promoter region of MTs partially contributed to their reduced expression in GC. Our comprehensive analyses from multiple independent databases may further lead researches to explore MT-targeting reagents or potential diagnostic and prognostic markers for GC patients.	2019	Evaluation of MT Family Isoforms as Potential Biomarker for Predicting Progression and Prognosis in Gastric Cancer.	31380415	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6682463	10.1016/j.canlet.2019.06.011	Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histological subtype of breast cancer following invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). To identify potential genetic drivers of ILC progression, we used NanoString nCounter technology to investigate the DNA copy number (CN) in 70 well-curated primary ILC samples. We confirmed prior observations of frequent amplification of CCND1 (33%), and MYC (17%) in ILC, but additionally identified a substantial subset of ILCs with ESR1 and ERBB2 (19%) amplifications. Of interest, tumors with ESR1 CN gains (14%) and amplification (10%) were more likely to recur compared to those with normal CN. Finally, we observed that MDM4 (MDMX) was amplified in 17% of ILC samples. MDM4 knockdown in TP53 wild-type ILC cell lines caused increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation associated with cell cycle arrest, and concomitant activation of TP53 target genes. Similar effects were seen in TP53 mutant cells, indicting a TP53-independent role for MDM4 in ILC. To conclude, amplification of ESR1 and MDM4 are potential genetic drivers of ILC. These amplifications may represent actionable, targetable tumor dependencies, and thus have potential clinical implications and warrant further study.	2019	Frequent amplifications of ESR1, ERBB2 and MDM4 in primary invasive lobular breast carcinoma.	31229512	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC8935314	10.1002/acn3.51527	<h4>Objective</h4>To define the proteomic profile of sporadic late-onset nemaline myopathy (SLONM) and explore its pathogenesis.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed mass spectrometry on laser-dissected frozen muscle samples from five patients with SLONM, three of whom with an associated monoclonal protein (MP), and four controls, to determine the proteomic profile of SLONM. Furthermore, we assessed the role of the MP by evaluating the expression of the immunoglobulin light chain variable regions (IGVL).<h4>Results</h4>There were 294 differentially expressed proteins: 272 upregulated and 22 downregulated. Among the top 100 upregulated proteins, the most common categories were: nuclear or nucleic acid metabolism (24%), extracellular matrix and basal lamina (17%), immune response (13%), and actin dynamics (8%). Downregulated proteins consisted mostly of contractile proteins. Among upregulated proteins, there were 65 with a role related to the immune system, including eight proteins involved in major histocompatibility complex 1 (MHC1) and antigen processing, 15 in MHCII complex and phagocytosis, and 23 in B and/or T-cell function. Among nine upregulated immunoglobulin proteins, there were two IGVL genes. However, these were also detected in SLONM cases without an MP, with no evidence of clonally dominant immunoglobulin deposition. In muscle sections from SLONM patients, nemaline rods tended to accumulate in atrophic fibers with marked rarefaction of the myofibrils. Increased MHC1 reactivity was present in fibers containing nemaline rods as well as adjacent nonatrophic fibers.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings suggest that aberrant immune activation is present in SLONM, but do not support a direct causal relationship between the MP and SLONM.	2022	Proteomic profiling of sporadic late-onset nemaline myopathy.	35187860	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9826883	10.1016/j.mbplus.2022.100127	"Although most work has focused on resolution of collagen ECM, fibrosis resolution involves changes to several ECM proteins. The purpose of the current study was twofold: 1) to examine the role of MMP12 and elastin; and 2) to investigate the changes in degraded proteins in plasma (i.e., the ""degradome"") in a preclinical model of fibrosis resolution. Fibrosis was induced by 4 weeks carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) exposure, and recovery was monitored for an additional 4 weeks. Some mice were treated with daily MMP12 inhibitor (MMP408) during the resolution phase. Liver injury and fibrosis was monitored by clinical chemistry, histology and gene expression. The release of degraded ECM peptides in the plasma was analyzed using by 1D-LC-MS/MS, coupled with PEAKS Studio (v10) peptide identification. Hepatic fibrosis and liver injury rapidly resolved in this mouse model. However, some collagen fibrils were still present 28d after cessation of CCl<sub>4</sub>. Despite this persistent collagen presence, expression of canonical markers of fibrosis were also normalized. The inhibition of MMP12 dramatically delayed fibrosis resolution under these conditions. LC-MS/MS analysis identified that several proteins were being degraded even at late stages of fibrosis resolution. Calpains 1/2 were identified as potential new proteases involved in fibrosis resolution. CONCLUSION. The results of this study indicate that remodeling of the liver during recovery from fibrosis is a complex and highly coordinated process that extends well beyond the degradation of the collagenous scar. These results also indicate that analysis of the plasma degradome may yield new insight into the mechanisms of fibrosis recovery, and by extension, new ""theragnostic"" targets. Lastly, a novel potential role for calpain activation in the degradation and turnover of proteins was identified."	2023	Fibrosis resolution in the mouse liver: Role of Mmp12 and potential role of calpain 1/2.	36632559	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6294500	10.1093/nar/gky1107	Recent studies suggest that transcription takes place at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), that transcripts at DSBs are processed by Drosha and Dicer into damage-induced small RNAs (diRNAs), and that diRNAs are required for DNA repair. However, diRNAs have been mostly detected in reporter constructs or repetitive sequences, and their existence at endogenous loci has been questioned by recent reports. Using the homing endonuclease I-PpoI, we have investigated diRNA production in genetically unperturbed human and mouse cells. I-PpoI is an ideal tool to clarify the requirements for diRNA production because it induces DSBs in different types of loci: the repetitive 28S locus, unique genes and intergenic loci. We show by extensive sequencing that the rDNA locus produces substantial levels of diRNAs, whereas unique genic and intergenic loci do not. Further characterization of diRNAs emerging from the 28S locus reveals the existence of two diRNA subtypes. Surprisingly, Drosha and its partner DGCR8 are dispensable for diRNA production and only one diRNAs subtype depends on Dicer processing. Furthermore, we provide evidence that diRNAs are incorporated into Argonaute. Our findings provide direct evidence for diRNA production at endogenous loci in mammalian cells and give insights into RNA processing at DSBs.	2018	Next-generation sequencing reveals two populations of damage-induced small RNAs at endogenous DNA double-strand breaks.	30418607	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

The aim of this systematic review is to identify a molecular signature that is predictive of colon cancer downstaging and/or downgrading after neoadjuvant therapy. Among the hundreds analysed in the available studies, only 19 messenger-RNAs (mRNAs) and six micro-RNAs (miRNAs) were differentially expressed in responders versus non-responders in two or more independent studies. Therefore, a mRNA/miRNA signature can be designed accordingly, with limitations caused by the retrospective nature of these studies, the heterogeneity in study designs and the downgrading/downstaging assessment criteria. This signature can be proposed to tailor neoadjuvant therapy regimens on an individual basis.	2020	Predicting Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Patients the Role of Messenger-and Micro-RNA Profiling. 	32580435	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC5960535	10.1155/2018/5038172	This work is aimed at investigating the effect of melittin on identified key genes in bladder cancer (BC) and further providing a theoretical basis for BC treatment. GSE35014 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BC cells and control. Results showed that a total of 389 upregulated and 169 downregulated genes were identified. Subsequently, GO analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and PPI network analysis were employed to disclose the crucial genes and signaling pathways involved in BC. Fifteen module-related DEGs and their associated signaling pathways were obtained according to the PPI network and modular analyses. Based on the analysis of articles retrieved in the PubMed database, we found that melittin could induce apoptosis and constrain the progression of tumor cells as a result of regulating critical cancer-related signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt and TNF signaling pathways. Furthermore, PI3K-Akt and TNF signaling pathways were also found to be associated with module-related DEGs according to biological analyses. At last, qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that melittin could constrain the expression of module-related DEGs (LPAR1, COL5A1, COL6A2, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3) associated with PI3K-Akt and TNF signaling pathways in BC cells. Functional assays revealed that melittin could constrain the proliferative and migrated abilities of BC cells. Conjointly, these findings provide a theoretical basis for these six genes as drug-sensitive markers of melittin in BC treatment.	2018	Melittin Constrains the Expression of Identified Key Genes Associated with Bladder Cancer.	29854840	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6995802	10.1186/s40169-020-0256-3	Completion of the human genome sequencing project highlighted the richness of the cellular RNA world, and opened the door to the discovery of a plethora of short and long non-coding RNAs (the dark transcriptome) with regulatory or structural potential, which shifted the balance of pathological gene alterations from coding to non-coding RNAs. Thus, disease risk assessment currently has to also evaluate the expression of new RNAs such as small micro RNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), retrogressed elements, 3'UTRs of mRNAs, etc. We are interested in the pathogenic mechanisms of atherosclerosis (ATH) progression in patients suffering Chronic Kidney Disease, and in this review, we will focus in the role of the dark transcriptome (non-coding RNAs) in ATH progression. We will focus in miRNAs and in the formation of regulatory axes or networks with their mRNA targets and with the lncRNAs that function as miRNA sponges or competitive inhibitors of miRNA activity. In this sense, we will pay special attention to retrogressed genomic elements, such as processed pseudogenes and Alu repeated elements, that have been recently seen to also function as miRNA sponges, as well as to the use or miRNA derivatives in gene silencing, anti-ATH therapies. Along the review, we will discuss technical developments associated to research in lncRNAs, from sequencing technologies to databases, repositories and algorithms to predict miRNA targets, as well as new approaches to miRNA function, such as integrative or enrichment analysis and their potential to unveil RNA regulatory networks.	2020	Unveiling ncRNA regulatory axes in atherosclerosis progression.	32009226	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9684942	10.1007/s00335-022-09967-8	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) determines mRNA stability, localisation, translation and protein function. Several diseases, including obesity, have been linked to APA. Studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals (PAS-SNPs) can influence APA and affect phenotype and disease susceptibility. However, these studies focussed on associations between single PAS-SNP alleles with very large effects and phenotype. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide screening for PAS-SNPs in the polygenic mouse selection lines for fatness and leanness by whole-genome sequencing. The genetic variants identified in the two lines were overlapped with locations of PAS sites obtained from the PolyASite 2.0 database. Expression data for selected genes were extracted from the microarray expression experiment performed on multiple tissue samples. In total, 682 PAS-SNPs were identified within 583 genes involved in various biological processes, including transport, protein modifications and degradation, cell adhesion and immune response. Moreover, 63 of the 583 orthologous genes in human have been previously associated with human diseases, such as nervous system and physical disorders, and immune, endocrine, and metabolic diseases. In both lines, PAS-SNPs have also been identified in genes broadly involved in APA, such as Polr2c, Eif3e and Ints11. Five PAS-SNPs within 5 genes (Car, Col4a1, Itga7, Lat, Nmnat1) were prioritised as potential functional variants and could contribute to the phenotypic disparity between the two selection lines. The developed PAS-SNPs catalogue presents a key resource for planning functional studies to uncover the role of PAS-SNPs in APA, disease susceptibility and fat deposition.	2023	Genome-wide screening for genetic variants in polyadenylation signal (PAS) sites in mouse selection lines for fatness and leanness. 	36414820	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC7425812	10.1038/s41556-020-0550-8	It remains unknown if biophysical or material properties of biomolecular condensates regulate cancer. Here we show that AKAP95, a nuclear protein that regulates transcription and RNA splicing, plays an important role in tumorigenesis by supporting cancer cell growth and suppressing oncogene-induced senescence. AKAP95 forms phase-separated and liquid-like condensates in vitro and in nucleus. Mutations of key residues to different amino acids perturb AKAP95 condensation in opposite directions. Importantly, the activity of AKAP95 in splice regulation is abolished by disruption of condensation, significantly impaired by hardening of condensates, and regained by substituting its condensation-mediating region with other condensation-mediating regions from irrelevant proteins. Moreover, the abilities of AKAP95 in regulating gene expression and supporting tumorigenesis require AKAP95 to form condensates with proper liquidity and dynamicity. These results link phase separation to tumorigenesis and uncover an important role of appropriate biophysical properties of protein condensates in gene regulation and cancer.	2020	Biophysical properties of AKAP95 protein condensates regulate splicing and tumorigenesis.	32719551	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

Copy-number variations (CNVs) analysis by next-generation sequencing serves to identify critical cancer-related genomic regions. Thirty-three female cats with FMCs were followed during two years after surgery. Tumours represented tubulopapillary and solid carcinomas encompassing six molecular subtypes. Regardless of the histopathological diagnosis, molecular subtypes showed important differences in survival. Luminal A tumours exhibited the highest DFS (p = 0.002) and cancer-specific OS (p = 0.001), and the lowest amount of CNVs (p = 0.0001). In contrast, basal-like triple-negative FMCs had the worst outcome (DFS, p < 0.0001; and OS, p < 0.00001) and were the most aberrant (p = 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, copy-number losses (CNLs) in chromosome B1 (1-23 Mb) harbouring several tumour-repressors (e.g. CSMD1, MTUS1, MSR1, DBC2, and TUSC3) negatively influenced DFS. Whereas, copy-number gains (CNGs) in B4 (1-29 Mb) and F2 (64-82.3 Mb) comprising epithelial to mesenchymal transition genes and metastasis-promoting transcription factors (e.g. GATA3, VIM, ZEB1, and MYC) negatively influenced DFS and cancer-specific OS. These data evidence an association between specific CNVs in chromosomes B1, B4 and F2, and poor prognosis in FMCs.	2020	Analysis of Copy-Number Variations and Feline Mammary Carcinoma Survival.	31969654	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

The clinical picture is characterized by severe muscle weakness, brain abnormalities and delayed motor milestones defining MDC1A as one of the most severe forms of congenital muscular diseases. Although the molecular genetic basis of this neurological disease is well-known and molecular studies of mouse muscle and human cultured muscle cells allowed first insights into the underlying pathophysiology, the definition of marker proteins in human vulnerable tissue such as skeletal muscle is still lacking. To systematically address this need, we analyzed the proteomic signature of laminin-211-deficient vastus muscle derived from four patients and identified 86 proteins (35 were increased and 51 decreased) as skeletal muscle markers and verified paradigmatic findings in a total of two further MDC1A muscle biopsies. Functions of proteins suggests fibrosis but also hints at altered synaptic transmission and accords with central nervous system alterations as part of the clinical spectrum of MDC1A. In addition, a profound mitochondrial vulnerability of the laminin-211-deficient muscle is indicated and also altered abundances of other proteins support the concept that metabolic alterations could be novel mechanisms that underline MDC1A and might constitute therapeutic targets. Intersection of our data with the proteomic signature of murine laminin-211-deficient gastrocnemius and diaphragm allowed the definition of nine common vulnerable proteins representing potential tissue markers.	2019	Identification of Candidate Protein Markers in Skeletal Muscle of Laminin-211-Deficient CMD Type 1A-Patients.	31133972	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

Here, using deep sequencing and iTRAQ proteomics technologies we first identified 3159 circRNAs, 356 miRNAs, and 755 proteins in the longissimus dorsi tissues from Sichuan white (SCWrabs) and Germany great line ZIKA rabbits (ZIKArabs). Next, we identified 267 circRNAs, 3 miRNAs, and 29 proteins differentially expressed in the muscle tissues of SCWrabs and ZIKArabs. Interaction network analysis revealed some key regulation relationships between noncoding RNAs and proteins that might be associated with the muscle fiber type and meat quality of rabbit. Further, miRNA isoforms and gene variants identified in SCWrabs and ZIKArabs revealed some pathways and biological processes related to the muscle development. This is the first study of noncoding RNA and protein profiles for the two rabbit breeds.

We modified the integration machinery of LVs and harnessed the cellular DNA double-strand break repair machinery to integrate transgenes into ribosomal DNA, a promising genomic safe-harbor site for transgenes. LVs carrying modified I-PpoI-derived homing endonuclease proteins were characterized in detail, and we found that at least 21% of all integration sites localized to ribosomal DNA when LV transduction was coupled to target DNA cleavage. In addition to the primary sequence recognized by the endonuclease, integration was also enriched in chromatin domains topologically associated with nucleoli, which contain the targeted ribosome RNA genes. Targeting of this highly repetitive region for integration was not associated with detectable DNA deletions or negative impacts on cell health in transduced primary human T cells. The modified LVs characterized here have an overall lower risk for insertional mutagenesis than regular LVs and can thus improve the safety of gene and cellular therapy.	2020	Efficient Nuclease-Directed Integration of Lentivirus Vectors into the Human Ribosomal DNA Locus.	32504545	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC5898006	10.1186/s12014-018-9192-2	<h4>Background</h4>Colorectal cancer is the third most common and the fourth most lethal cancer in the world. In the majority of cases, patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage or even metastatic, thus explaining the high mortality. The standard treatment for patients with locally advanced non-metastatic rectal cancer is neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) followed by surgery, but the resistance rate to this treatment remains high with approximately 30% of non-responders. The lack of evidence available in clinical practice to predict NRCT resistance to 5-FU and to guide clinical practice therefore encourages the search for biomarkers of this resistance.<h4>Methods</h4>From twenty-three formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies performed before NRCT with 5-FU of locally advanced non-metastatic rectal cancer patients, we extracted and analysed the tumor proteome of these patients. From clinical data, we were able to classify the twenty-three patients in our cohort into three treatment response groups: non-responders (NR), partial responders (PR) and total responders (TR), and to compare the proteomes of these different groups.<h4>Results</h4>We have highlighted 384 differentially abundant proteins between NR and PR, 248 between NR and TR and 417 between PR and TR. Among these proteins, we have identified many differentially abundant proteins identified as having a role in cancer (IFIT1, FASTKD2, PIP4K2B, ARID1B, SLC25A33: overexpressed in TR; CALD1, CPA3, B3GALT5, CD177, RIPK1: overexpressed in NR). We have also identified that DPYD, the main degradation enzyme of 5-FU, was overexpressed in NR, as well as several ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins also overexpressed in NR. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008440.<h4>Conclusions</h4>From these retrospective study, we implemented a protein extraction protocol from FFPE biopsy to highlight protein differences between different response groups to RCTN with 5-FU in patients with locally advanced non-metastatic rectal cancer. These results will pave the way for a larger cohort for better sensitivity and specificity of the signature to guide decisions in the choice of treatment.	2018	The response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil in locally advanced rectal cancer patients: a predictive proteomic signature.	29681787	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs derived from the placenta circulate in the maternal blood during pregnancy and may be used as non-invasive biomarkers for pregnancy complications. With the intent to identify putative markers of fetal growth restriction (FGR) and new therapeutic druggable targets, we examined, in maternal blood samples, the expression of a group of microRNAs, known to be regulated by hypoxia. The expression of microRNAs was evaluated in maternal plasma samples collected from (1) women carrying a preterm FGR fetus (FGR group) or (2) women with an appropriately grown fetus matched at the same gestational age (Control group). To discriminate between early- and late-onset FGR, the study population was divided into two subgroups according to the gestational age at delivery. Four microRNAs were identified as possible candidates for the diagnosis of FGR: miR-16-5p, miR-103-3p, miR-107-3p, and miR-27b-3p. All four selected miRNAs, measured by RT-PCR, resulted upregulated in FGR blood samples before the 32nd week of gestation. By contrast, miRNA103-3p and miRNA107-3p, analyzed between the 32nd and 37th week of gestation, showed lower expression in the FGR group compared to aged matched controls. Our results showed that measurement of miRNAs in maternal blood may form the basis for a future diagnostic test to determine the degree of fetal hypoxia in FGR, thus allowing the start of appropriate therapeutic interventions to alleviate the burden of this disease.	2021	miR-16-5p, miR-103-3p, and miR-27b-3p as Early Peripheral Biomarkers of Fetal Growth Restriction.	33777862	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6297388	10.3389/fnins.2018.00937	Teneurins are large transmembrane proteins originally identified in <i>Drosophila</i>. Their essential role in development of the central nervous system is conserved throughout species, and evidence supports their involvement in organogenesis of additional tissues. Homophilic and heterophilic interactions between Teneurin paralogues mediate cellular adhesion in crucial processes such as neuronal pathfinding and synaptic organization. At the molecular level, Teneurins are proteolytically processed into distinct subdomains that have been implicated in extracellular and intracellular signaling, and in transcriptional regulation. Phylogenetic studies have shown a high degree of intra- and interspecies conservation of Teneurin genes. Accordingly, the occurrence of genetic variants has been associated with functional and phenotypic alterations in experimental systems, and with some inherited or sporadic conditions. Recently, tumor-related variations in Teneurin gene expression have been associated with patient survival in different cancers. Although these findings were incidental and molecular mechanisms were not addressed, they suggested a potential utility of Teneurin transcript levels as biomarkers for disease prognosis. Mutations and chromosomal alterations affecting Teneurin genes have been found occasionally in tumors, but literature remains scarce. The analysis of open-access molecular and clinical datasets derived from large oncologic cohorts provides an invaluable resource for the identification of additional somatic mutations. However, Teneurin variants have not been classified in terms of pathogenic risk and their phenotypic impact remains unknown. On this basis, is it plausible to hypothesize that Teneurins play a role in carcinogenesis? Does current evidence support a tumor suppressive or rather oncogenic function for these proteins? Here, we comprehensively discuss available literature with integration of molecular evidence retrieved from open-access databases. We show that Teneurins undergo somatic changes comparable to those of well-established cancer genes, and discuss their involvement in cancer-related signaling pathways. Current data strongly suggest a functional contribution of Teneurins to human carcinogenesis.	2018	Teneurins: An Integrative Molecular, Functional, and Biomedical Overview of Their Role in Cancer.	30618566	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC8892102	10.3389/fcell.2022.833127	Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is an ancient, ubiquitous, and well-conserved polymer which is present in all the studied organisms. It is formed by individual subunits of orthophosphate which are linked by structurally similar bonds and isoenergetic to those found in ATP. While the metabolism and the physiological roles of polyP have already been described in some organisms, including bacteria and yeast, the exact role of this polymer in mammalian physiology still remains poorly understood. In these organisms, polyP shows a co-localization with mitochondria, and its role as a key regulator of the stress responses, including the maintenance of appropriate bioenergetics, has already been demonstrated by our group and others. Here, using Wild-type (Wt) and MitoPPX (cells enzymatically depleted of mitochondrial polyP) SH-SY5Y cells, we have conducted a comprehensive study of the status of cellular physiology, using proteomics and metabolomics approaches. Our results suggest a clear dysregulation of mitochondrial physiology, especially of bioenergetics, in MitoPPX cells when compared with Wt cells. Moreover, the effects induced by the enzymatic depletion of polyP are similar to those present in the mitochondrial dysfunction that is observed in neurodegenerative disorders and in neuronal aging. Based on our findings, the metabolism of mitochondrial polyP could be a valid and innovative pharmacological target in these conditions.	2022	Mitochondrial Inorganic Polyphosphate (polyP) Is a Potent Regulator of Mammalian Bioenergetics in SH-SY5Y Cells: A Proteomics and Metabolomics Study.	35252194	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC3888727	10.1155/2013/381815	Garlic (Allium sativum L.) has been used to alleviate a variety of health problems due to its high content of organosulfur compounds and antioxidant activity. The main active component is alliin (S-allyl cysteine sulfoxide), a potent antioxidant with cardioprotective and neuroprotective actions. In addition, it helps to decrease serum levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and uric acid, as well as insulin resistance, and reduces cytokine levels. However its potential anti-inflammatory effect is unknown. We examined the effects of alliin in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by RT-PCR, Western blot, and microarrays analysis of 22,000 genes. Incubation of cells for 24 h with 100 μmol/L alliin prevented the increase in the expression of proinflammatory genes, IL-6, MCP-1, and Egr-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to 100 ng/mL LPS for 1 h. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which is involved in LPS-induced inflammation in adipocytes, was decreased following alliin treatment. Furthermore, the gene expression profile by microarrays evidentiate an upregulation of genes involved in immune response and downregulation of genes related with cancer. The present results have shown that alliin is able to suppress the LPS inflammatory signals by generating an anti-inflammatory gene expression profile and by modifying adipocyte metabolic profile.	2013	Alliin, a garlic (Allium sativum) compound, prevents LPS-induced inflammation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.	24453416	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6826327	10.3892/or.2019.7365	Adipocyte infiltration in pancreatic cancer (PC) has been demonstrated to be independently associated with PC risk and an active contributor to tumor progression. However, to date, little is known about these unique pancreatic tumor‑surrounding adipocytes, or their response to cancer cells. The present study utilized an in vitro indirect coculture model in which the phenotypic changes of adipocytes following exposure to PC cells were directly observed. RNA‑sequencing was performed on 3T3‑L1 adipocytes cultured with or without Panc‑1 cancer cells, and significant changes were identified at the transcriptional level. In terms of delipidation and the impaired function of glucose and lipid metabolism, coculture with tumor cells resulted in an altered metabolic phenotype in mature adipocytes. In co‑cultured adipocytes, the appearance of fibroblast‑like cells was observed, and the mesenchymal cell differentiation pathway was enriched following the integrated analysis into the transcriptome. In addition, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR analyses of co‑cultured adipocytes revealed a loss in gene expression of mature adipocyte markers, and a gain in gene expression of fibroblast‑specific markers. It was also confirmed that newly generated cancer‑associated adipocytes could facilitate the invasive capacities of the tumor, and may contribute to PC stromal remodeling. The present study supports a novel concept that reprogramming of stromal adipocytes orchestrated by PC cells may generate cancer‑associated adipocytes with activated phenotypes, which may ultimately drive pancreatic tumor progression.	2019	Cancer‑associated adipocytes exhibit distinct phenotypes and facilitate tumor progression in pancreatic cancer.	31638193	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9576445	10.1155/2022/9264555	Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide. This study aims to find the crucial exosomal miRNAs associated with IS by using bioinformatics methods, reveal potential biomarkers for IS, and investigate the association between the identified biomarker and immune cell pattern in the peripheral blood of IS patients. In this study, 3 up-regulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-184, and hsa-miR-16-5p) miRNAs in the serum exosomes between IS patients and healthy controls from GEO database (GSE199942) and 25 down-regulated genes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of IS patients from GSE22255 were obtained with the help of the R software. GO annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the 25 down-regulated genes were associated with coenzyme metabolic process and were mainly enriched in the N-glycan biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, we performed the LASSO algorithm to narrow down the above 25 intersected genes, and identified 8 key genes which had a good diagnostic value in discriminating IS patients from the healthy controls analyzed with ROC curve. CIBERSORT algorithm indicated that the abundance of M0 macrophages and resting mast cells was significantly lower than that of the control group. The spearman correlation analysis showed that STT3A was negatively correlated with the proportion of follicular helper T cells, activated NK cells and resting dendritic cells. Finally, GSE117064 showed that has-miR-16-5p was more advantageous for diagnosing stroke. In conclusion, hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-184, and hsa-miR-16-5p are identified as specific related exosomal miRNAs for IS patients. These genes may provide new targets for the early identification of IS.	2022	Identification of Differentially Expressed microRNAs Associated with Ischemic Stroke by Integrated Bioinformatics Approaches.	36262825	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC4777876	10.1002/ddr.21278	Preclinical Research Positive findings from preclinical and clinical studies involving depletion or supplementation of microRNA (miRNA) engender optimism about miRNA-based therapeutics. However, off-target effects must be considered. Predicting these effects is complicated. Each miRNA may target many gene transcripts, and the rules governing imperfectly complementary miRNA: target interactions are incompletely understood. Several databases provide lists of the relatively small number of experimentally confirmed miRNA: target pairs. Although incomplete, this information might allow assessment of at least some of the off-target effects. We evaluated the performance of four databases of experimentally validated miRNA: target interactions (miRWalk 2.0, miRTarBase, miRecords, and TarBase 7.0) using a list of 50 alphabetically consecutive genes. We examined the provided citations to determine the degree to which each interaction was experimentally supported. To assess stability, we tested at the beginning and end of a five-month period. Results varied widely by database. Two of the databases changed significantly over the course of 5 months. Most reported evidence for miRNA: target interactions were indirect or otherwise weak, and relatively few interactions were supported by more than one publication. Some returned results appear to arise from simplistic text searches that offer no insight into the relationship of the search terms, may not even include the reported gene or miRNA, and may thus, be invalid. We conclude that validation databases provide important information, but not all information in all extant databases is up-to-date or accurate. Nevertheless, the more comprehensive validation databases may provide useful starting points for investigation of off-target effects of proposed small RNA therapies.	2015	Validated MicroRNA Target Databases: An Evaluation.	26286669	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC8764203	10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.11.019	Alternate splicing events can create isoforms that alter gene function, and genetic variants associated with alternate gene isoforms may reveal molecular mechanisms of disease. We used subcutaneous adipose tissue of 426 Finnish men from the METSIM study and identified splice junction quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) for 6,077 splice junctions (FDR < 1%). In the same individuals, we detected expression QTLs (eQTLs) for 59,443 exons and 15,397 genes (FDR < 1%). We identified 595 genes with an sQTL and exon eQTL but no gene eQTL, which could indicate potential isoform differences. Of the significant sQTL signals, 2,114 (39.8%) included at least one proxy variant (linkage disequilibrium r<sup>2</sup> > 0.8) located within an intron spanned by the splice junction. We identified 203 sQTLs that colocalized with 141 genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals for cardiometabolic traits, including 25 signals for lipid traits, 24 signals for body mass index (BMI), and 12 signals for waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI. Among all 141 GWAS signals colocalized with an sQTL, we detected 26 that also colocalized with an exon eQTL for an exon skipped by the sQTL splice junction. At a GWAS signal for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol colocalized with an NR1H3 sQTL splice junction, we show that the alternative splice product encodes an NR1H3 transcription factor that lacks a DNA binding domain and fails to activate transcription. Together, these results detect splicing events and candidate mechanisms that may contribute to gene function at GWAS loci.	2022	Subcutaneous adipose tissue splice quantitative trait loci reveal differences in isoform usage associated with cardiometabolic traits.	34995504	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6518196	10.3390/jcm8040517	Coarctation of the aorta is a form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in paediatric patients that can be presented with either bicuspid (BAV) or normal tricuspid (TAV) aortic valve. The congenital BAV is associated with hemodynamic changes and can therefore trigger different molecular remodelling in the coarctation area. This study investigated the proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes associated with BAV for the first time in neonatal coarctation patients. Aortic tissue was collected just proximal to the coarctation site from 23 neonates (BAV; n = 10, TAV; n = 13) that were matched for age (age range 4-22 days). Tissue from half of the patients was frozen and used for proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis whilst the remaining tissue was formalin fixed and used for analysis of elastin content using Elastic Van-Gieson (EVG) staining. A total of 1796 protein and 75 phosphoprotein accession numbers were detected, of which 34 proteins and one phosphoprotein (SSH3) were differentially expressed in BAV patients compared to TAV patients. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified the formation of elastin fibres as a significantly enriched function (p = 1.12 × 10-4) due to the upregulation of EMILIN-1 and the downregulation of TNXB. Analysis of paraffin sections stained with EVG demonstrated increased elastin content in BAV patients. The proteomic/phosphoproteomic analysis also suggested changes in inositol signalling pathways and reduced expression of the antioxidant SOD3. This work demonstrates for the first time that coarcted aortic tissue in neonatal BAV patients has an altered proteome/phosphoproteome consistent with observed structural vascular changes when compared to TAV patients.	2019	Bicuspid Aortic Valve Alters Aortic Protein Expression Profile in Neonatal Coarctation Patients. 	30995723	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6693269	10.1186/s13287-019-1356-0	<h4>Background</h4>Taking advantage of cellular paracrine mechanisms, the secretome of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and adipose tissue has been demonstrated to induce tissue repair and regeneration in various ischemic and impaired conditions. However, these cell-based therapies have been hindered by issues, such as inherent safety and cost-efficiency for clinical applications. In this study, we prepared a liquid cell-free extract from human adipose tissue [adipose liquid extract (ALE)] and evaluated its potential therapeutic efficacy.<h4>Methods</h4>ALE was prepared from human subcutaneous adipose tissue using a rapid and physical approach, and the protein components in ALE were identified using mass spectrometry analysis. In vivo, the therapeutic effect of this agent was investigated on wound healing in C57BL/6 mice, and wound healing rate, vessel density, and neo-adipocyte formation in wounded skins were measured at days 3, 7, 11, and 14. In vitro, the effect of ALE on the viability of human ADSCs, tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs were tested.<h4>Results</h4>The results demonstrated that ALE contained a variety of growth factors and did not affect cell viability. ALE-treated wounds exhibited accelerated wound healing with increased vessel density and formation of neo-adipocytes compared to that of control wounds. Moreover, when added as a cell culture supplement, ALE effectively induced tube formation of HUVECs and lipid accumulation in ADSCs. ALE-treated ADSCs also exhibited elevated levels of adipogenic gene expression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ALE is a novel growth-rich therapeutic agent that is cell-free and easy to produce. Besides, it is also able to induce angiogenesis and adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, thus indicating that it could be used for wound repair and soft tissue regeneration.	2019	Human adipose liquid extract induces angiogenesis and adipogenesis: a novel cell-free therapeutic agent.	31412933	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC5663880	10.1074/jbc.m117.794008	The <i>MYO1C</i> gene produces three alternatively spliced isoforms, differing only in their N-terminal regions (NTRs). These isoforms, which exhibit both specific and overlapping nuclear and cytoplasmic functions, have different expression levels and nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning. To investigate the effect of NTR extensions on the enzymatic behavior of individual isoforms, we overexpressed and purified the three full-length human isoforms from suspension-adapted HEK cells. MYO1C<sup>C</sup> favored the actomyosin closed state (AM<sup>C</sup>), MYO1C<sup>16</sup> populated the actomyosin open state (AM<sup>O</sup>) and AM<sup>C</sup> equally, and MYO1C<sup>35</sup> favored the AM<sup>O</sup> state. Moreover, the full-length constructs isomerized before ADP release, which has not been observed previously in truncated MYO1C<sup>C</sup> constructs. Furthermore, global numerical simulation analysis predicted that MYO1C<sup>35</sup> populated the actomyosin·ADP closed state (AMD<sup>C</sup>) 5-fold more than the actomyosin·ADP open state (AMD<sup>O</sup>) and to a greater degree than MYO1C<sup>C</sup> and MYO1C<sup>16</sup> (4- and 2-fold, respectively). On the basis of a homology model of the 35-amino acid NTR of MYO1C<sup>35</sup> (NTR<sup>35</sup>) docked to the X-ray structure of MYO1C<sup>C</sup>, we predicted that MYO1C<sup>35</sup> NTR residue Arg-21 would engage in a specific interaction with post-relay helix residue Glu-469, which affects the mechanics of the myosin power stroke. In addition, we found that adding the NTR<sup>35</sup> peptide to MYO1C<sup>C</sup> yielded a protein that transiently mimics MYO1C<sup>35</sup> kinetic behavior. By contrast, NTR<sup>35</sup>, which harbors the R21G mutation, was unable to confer MYO1C<sup>35</sup>-like kinetic behavior. Thus, the NTRs affect the specific nucleotide-binding properties of MYO1C isoforms, adding to their kinetic diversity. We propose that this level of fine-tuning within MYO1C broadens its adaptability within cells.	2017	N-terminal splicing extensions of the human <i>MYO1C</i> gene fine-tune the kinetics of the three full-length myosin IC isoforms.	28893906	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC4284233	10.1083/jcb.201404109	Postmeiotic gene expression is essential for development and maturation of sperm and eggs. We report that the dual bromodomain-containing protein BRWD1, which is essential for both male and female fertility, promotes haploid spermatid-specific transcription but has distinct roles in oocyte meiotic progression. Brwd1 deficiency caused down-regulation of ∼300 mostly spermatid-specific transcripts in testis, including nearly complete elimination of those encoding the protamines and transition proteins, but was not associated with global epigenetic changes in chromatin, which suggests that BRWD1 acts selectively. In females, Brwd1 ablation caused severe chromosome condensation and structural defects associated with abnormal telomere structure but only minor changes in gene expression at the germinal vesicle stage, including more than twofold overexpression of the histone methyltransferase MLL5 and LINE-1 elements transposons. Thus, loss of BRWD1 function interferes with the completion of oogenesis and spermatogenesis through sexually dimorphic mechanisms: it is essential in females for epigenetic control of meiotic chromosome stability and in males for haploid gene transcription during postmeiotic sperm differentiation.	2015	Mouse BRWD1 is critical for spermatid postmeiotic transcription and female meiotic chromosome stability.	25547156	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6973177	10.3389/fimmu.2019.03064	The molecular mechanisms driving specific regulation of neutrophils are not completely understood to date. In order to characterize fundamental granulocyte features on protein level, we analyzed changes in proteome composition as reaction to stress from cell activation processes. For this purpose, we isolated primary granulocytes from equine whole blood through density gradient centrifugation followed by sodium chloride lysis and stimulated cells for 30 min with interleukin-8 (IL8) due to its role as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils. We additionally used phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which are primarily associated to neutrophil extracellular trap formation and release of reactive oxygen species. From mass spectrometry analysis, we identified a total of 2,032 proteins describing the whole granulocyte proteome, including 245 proteins (12% of identified proteome) newly associated to in vivo expression in primary equine granulocytes (hypothetical proteins). We also found distinct and different changes in protein abundance (ratio ≥ 2) after short stimulation of cells with various stimuli, pointing to rapid and differentiated reaction pattern. IL8 stimulation resulted in increased protein abundance of 58 proteins (3% of proteome), whereas PMA induced changed protein abundance of 207 (10 % of proteome) and LPS of 46 proteins (2% of proteome). Enrichment analyses clearly showed fundamental differences between stimuli, with primary association of IL8 stimulation to processes in immune response, receptor signaling and signal transduction. Top enrichment for PMA on the other hand pointed to vesicle mediated transport and exocytosis. Stimulation with LPS did not result in any significant enrichment. Although we detected 43% overlap of enrichment categories for IL8 and PMA stimulation, indicating that activation of neutrophils with different stimuli partly induces some similar biological processes and pathways, hierarchical clustering showed clear differences in distribution and biological relevance of clusters between the chosen stimuli. Our studies provide novel information on the granulocyte proteome and offer insights into early, differentiated granulocyte reaction to stimuli, which contribute to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in activation and recruitment of neutrophils, through inflammatory stimuli.	2019	IL8 and PMA Trigger the Regulation of Different Biological Processes in Granulocyte Activation.	32010136	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

In time, HERVs accumulated mutations that compromised their coding capacity. A prominent exception is HERV-W locus 7q21.2, producing a functional Env protein (Syncytin-1) coopted for placental syncytiotrophoblast formation. While expression of HERV-W sequences has been investigated for their correlation to disease, an exhaustive description of the group composition and characteristics is still not available and current HERV-W group information derive from studies published a few years ago that, of course, used the rough assemblies of the human genome available at that time. This hampers the comparison and correlation with current human genome assemblies.<h4>Results</h4>In the present work we identified and described in detail the distribution and genetic composition of 213 HERV-W elements. The bioinformatics analysis led to the characterization of several previously unreported features and provided a phylogenetic classification of two main subgroups with different age and structural characteristics. New facts on HERV-W genomic context of insertion and co-localization with sequences putatively involved in disease development are also reported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present work is a detailed overview of the HERV-W contribution to the human genome and provides a robust genetic background useful to clarify HERV-W role in pathologies with poorly understood etiology, representing, to our knowledge, the most complete and exhaustive HERV-W dataset up to date.	2016	Contribution of type W human endogenous retroviruses to the human genome: characterization of HERV-W proviral insertions and processed pseudogenes.	27613107	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

However, the specific mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear.<h4>Objective</h4>To investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of PSP treatment on brain ageing by the application of transcriptomic analysis.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Forty Kunming mice were randomly divided into four groups (control, d-galactose, low-dose PSP, high-dose PSP). Mice were administered d-galactose (50 mg/kg, hypodermic injection) and PSP (200 or 400 mg/kg, intragastric administration) daily for 60 days. Behavioural responses were evaluated with the Morris water maze and the profiles of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA, in the brains of experimental mice were investigated during the ageing process with and without PSP treatment.<h4>Results</h4>PSP improved cognitive function during brain ageing, as evidenced by a reduced escape latency time (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and an increase in the number of times mice crossed the platform (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A total of 37, 13, and 679, circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, respectively, were significantly altered by PSP treatment (as evidenced by a fold change ≥2 and <i>p</i> < 0.05). These dysregulated RNAs were closely associated with synaptic activity.

PMC4870338	10.1155/2016/3605302	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Despite of advances in diagnosis and treatment, biomarkers of RSV infection are still unclear. To understand the host response and propose signatures of RSV infection, previous studies evaluated the transcriptional profile of the human bronchial epithelial cell line-BEAS-2B-infected with different strains of this virus. However, the evolution of statistical methods and functional analysis together with the large amount of expression data provide opportunities to uncover novel biomarkers of inflammation and infections. In view of those facts publicly available microarray datasets from RSV-infected BEAS-2B cells were analyzed with linear model-based statistics and the platform for functional analysis InnateDB. The results from those analyses argue for the reevaluation of previously reported transcription patterns and biological pathways in BEAS-2B cell lines infected with RSV. Importantly, this study revealed a biosignature constituted by genes such as ABCC4, ARMC8, BCLAF1, EZH1, FAM118A, FAM208B, FUS, HSPH1, KAZN, MAP3K2, N6AMT1, PRMT2, S100PBP, SERPINA1, TLK2, ZNF322, and ZNF337 which should be considered in the development of new molecular diagnosis tools.	2016	A Cross-Study Biomarker Signature of Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells Infected with Respiratory Syncytial Virus.	27274726	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

Although aneurysms can dissect in a size-dependent process, most descending dissections will occur without prior enlargement. We compared the proteomic profiles of normal, dissected, aneurysm, and both aneurysm and dissected descending thoracic aortas to identify novel biomarkers and further understand the molecular pathways that lead to tissue at risk of dissection.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed proteomic profiling of descending thoracic aortas with four phenotypes: normal (n = 46), aneurysm (n = 22), dissected (n = 12), and combined aneurysm and dissection (n = 8). Pairwise differential protein expression analyses using a Bayesian approach were then performed to identify common proteins that were dysregulated between each diseased tissue type and control aorta and to uncover unique proteins between aneurysmal and dissected aortas. Network and Markov cluster algorithms of differentially expressed proteins were used to find enriched ontology processes. A convex analysis of mixtures was also performed to identify the molecular subtypes within the different tissue types.<h4>Results</h4>The diseased aortas had 71 common differentially expressed proteins compared with the control, including higher amounts of the protein thrombospondin 1. We found 42 differentially expressed proteins between the aneurysm and dissected tissue, with an abundance of apolipoproteins in the former and higher quantities of extracellular matrix proteins in the latter. The convex analysis of mixtures showed enhancement of a molecular subtype enriched in contractile proteins within the control tissue compared with the diseased tissue, in addition to increased proportions of molecular subtypes enriched in inflammation and red blood cell expression in the aneurysmal compared with the dissected tissue.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We found some overlapping differentially expressed proteins in aneurysmal and nonaneurysmal descending thoracic aortas at risk of dissection compared with normal aortas. However, we also found uniquely altered molecular pathways that might uncover mechanisms for dissection.	2022	Proteomic analysis of descending thoracic aorta identifies unique and universal signatures of aneurysm and dissection.	35280433	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC4288319	10.3389/fimmu.2014.00655	Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are expressed in cells but only a few have been well characterized. In these cases, lncRNAs have been shown to be key regulators of several cellular processes. Therefore, there is a great need to understand the function of more lncRNAs and their regulation in response to stimuli. Interferon (IFN) is a key molecule in the cellular antiviral response. IFN binding to its receptor activates transcription of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that function as potent antivirals. In addition, several ISGs are positive or negative regulators of the IFN pathway. This is essential to ensure a strong antiviral response and a later return of the cell to homeostasis. As the ISGs described to date are coding genes, we sought to determine whether IFN also regulates the expression of long non-coding ISGs. To this aim, we used RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of control and HuH7 cells treated with IFNα2. The results show that IFN-treatment regulates the expression of several unknown non-coding transcripts. We have validated two lncRNAs upregulated after treatment with different doses of type I IFNα2 in different cells or with type III IFNλ. These lncRNAs were also induced by influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus mutants unable to block the IFN response, but not by several wild-type lytic viruses tested. These lncRNA genes were named lncISG15 and lncBST2 as they are located close to ISGs ISG15 and BST2, respectively. Interestingly, inhibition experiments showed that lncBST2 is a positive regulator of BST2. Therefore lncBST2 has been renamed BISPR, from BST2 IFN-stimulated positive regulator. Our results may have therapeutic implications as lncBST2/BISPR, but also lncISG15 and their coding neighbors, are increased in cells infected with hepatitis C virus and in the liver of infected patients. These results allow us to hypothesize that several lncRNAs could be activated by IFN to control the potency of the antiviral IFN response.	2014	Long Non-Coding RNA BST2/BISPR is Induced by IFN and Regulates the Expression of the Antiviral Factor Tetherin.	25620967	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

This circuit plays a central role in the nicotine withdrawal response. Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs were validated using RT-qPCR. Many of the differentially expressed mRNAs are predicted targets of reciprocally expressed miRNAs. We illustrate the utility of the dataset by demonstrating that knockdown in the interpeduncular nucleus of a differentially expressed mRNA, that encoding profilin 2, is sufficient to induce anxiety-related behavior. Importantly, profilin 2 knockdown in the ventral tegmental area did not affect anxiety behavior. Our data reveal wide-spread changes in gene expression within the habenulo-interpeduncular circuit during nicotine withdrawal.

As an extension of this study, here, we aimed to identify potential regulators of sheep fecundity using a genome-wide analysis of miRNAs and the methylated genes encoding mRNAs and lncRNAs in the ovaries of Dorset sheep (low fecundity) and Small Tail Han ewes (high fecundity) with the genotype BB (Han BB) and the genotype ++ (Han ++) by performing RNA-Seq and MeDIP-Seq analyses. Methylated coding-non-coding gene co-expression networks for Han and Dorset sheep were constructed using the methylated genes encoding the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs identified in this study. In the Han BB vs. Dorset comparison, the lncRNAs TTC26 and MYH15 had the largest degree. Similarly, the lncRNA NYAP1 had the largest degree in the Han ++ vs. Dorset comparison. None of the methylated genes encoding lncRNAs were co-expressed with the methylated genes encoding mRNAs in the Han BB vs. Han ++ comparison. The methylated genes encoding lncRNAs identified here may play a vital regulatory role in sheep breeding. Our results suggest that miRNAs might play a key role in sheep prolificacy by regulating target genes related to thyroid hormone synthesis, and methylated genes encoding lncRNAs associated with tight junctions might contribute to the high breeding rate in Han sheep. These findings may contribute to a deeper understanding of sheep prolificacy.	2017	An Integrated Analysis of miRNAs and Methylated Genes Encoding mRNAs and lncRNAs in Sheep Breeds with Different Fecundity.	29326596	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC8424232	10.1016/j.jbc.2021.101023	Ammonia is a cytotoxic molecule generated during normal cellular functions. Dysregulated ammonia metabolism, which is evident in many chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, initiates a hyperammonemic stress response in tissues including skeletal muscle and in myotubes. Perturbations in levels of specific regulatory molecules have been reported, but the global responses to hyperammonemia are unclear. In this study, we used a multiomics approach to vertically integrate unbiased data generated using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing, RNA-Seq, and proteomics. We then horizontally integrated these data across different models of hyperammonemia, including myotubes and mouse and human muscle tissues. Changes in chromatin accessibility and/or expression of genes resulted in distinct clusters of temporal molecular changes including transient, persistent, and delayed responses during hyperammonemia in myotubes. Known responses to hyperammonemia, including mitochondrial and oxidative dysfunction, protein homeostasis disruption, and oxidative stress pathway activation, were enriched in our datasets. During hyperammonemia, pathways that impact skeletal muscle structure and function that were consistently enriched were those that contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and senescence. We made several novel observations, including an enrichment in antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 family protein expression, increased calcium flux, and increased protein glycosylation in myotubes and muscle tissue upon hyperammonemia. Critical molecules in these pathways were validated experimentally. Human skeletal muscle from patients with cirrhosis displayed similar responses, establishing translational relevance. These data demonstrate complex molecular interactions during adaptive and maladaptive responses during the cellular stress response to hyperammonemia.	2021	Integrated multiomics analysis identifies molecular landscape perturbations during hyperammonemia in skeletal muscle and myotubes.	34343564	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC7610439	10.1038/s41588-020-00713-x	Genetic studies of blood pressure (BP) to date have mainly analyzed common variants (minor allele frequency > 0.05). In a meta-analysis of up to ~1.3 million participants, we discovered 106 new BP-associated genomic regions and 87 rare (minor allele frequency ≤ 0.01) variant BP associations (P < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), of which 32 were in new BP-associated loci and 55 were independent BP-associated single-nucleotide variants within known BP-associated regions. Average effects of rare variants (44% coding) were ~8 times larger than common variant effects and indicate potential candidate causal genes at new and known loci (for example, GATA5 and PLCB3). BP-associated variants (including rare and common) were enriched in regions of active chromatin in fetal tissues, potentially linking fetal development with BP regulation in later life. Multivariable Mendelian randomization suggested possible inverse effects of elevated systolic and diastolic BP on large artery stroke. Our study demonstrates the utility of rare-variant analyses for identifying candidate genes and the results highlight potential therapeutic targets.	2020	Discovery of rare variants associated with blood pressure regulation through meta-analysis of 1.3 million individuals.	33230300	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC6609318	10.3892/or.2019.7200	Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and numerous secreted factors may differentially contribute to a macrophage phenotype whose extensive infiltration is generally regarded as indicative of an unfavorable outcome. How different breast tumor cells and macrophage cells interplay or influence each other on the alternative splicing (AS) level have not been characterized. Here, we exploited one previous study, which investigated the interplay between macrophages and estrogen receptor‑positive (ER+) breast cancer and triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) at the transcriptional level, to investigate the tumor‑macrophage crosstalk at the AS level. In the present study, it was demonstrated that biological processes such as DNA damage and DNA repair were significantly affected both in ER+ breast cancer and TNBC by co‑culturing with macrophages, whereas biological pathways altered in macrophages co‑cultured with tumor cells depended on the breast cancer type. Specifically, biological processes altered in macrophages co‑cultured with ER+ breast cancer were enriched in RNA processing and translation‑related pathways whereas biological processes altered in macrophages co‑cultured with TNBC were mainly enriched in protein transport pathways. We also analyzed the sequence features of skip exons among different conditions. In addition, putative splicing factors which were responsible for the altered AS profile in each condition were identified. The findings of the present study revealed significant tumor‑macrophage crosstalk at the AS level which may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer.	2019	Mutual editing of alternative splicing between breast cancer cells and macrophages.	31233192	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

To identify cutaneous gene transcription changes in relatively early inflammation of canine AD, microarrays were used to monitor transcription in normal skin (n=13) and in acute lesional AD (ALAD) and nearby visibly nonlesional AD (NLAD) skin (n=13) from dogs. Scanning the putative abnormally transcribed genes, several potentially relevant genes, some abnormally transcribed in both NLAD and ALAD (e.g. IL6, NFAM1, MSRA, and SYK), were observed. Comparison for abnormally transcribed genes common to two related human diseases, human AD and asthmatic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (aCRSwNP), further identified genes or gene sets likely relevant to eosinophilic allergic inflammation. These included: (1) genes associated with alternatively activated monocyte-derived cells, including members of the monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) gene cluster, (2) members of the IL1 family gene cluster, (3) eosinophil-associated seven transmembrane receptor EMR1 and EMR3 genes, (4) interferon-inducible genes, and (5) keratin genes associated with hair and nail formation. Overall, numerous abnormally transcribed genes were observed only in canine AD; however, many others are common to related human eosinophilic allergic diseases and represent therapeutic targets testable in dogs with AD.	2012	Gene transcription abnormalities in canine atopic dermatitis and related human eosinophilic allergic diseases.	22749291	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC4618693	10.1371/journal.ppat.1005219	Memory CD8 T cells confer increased protection to immune hosts upon secondary viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. The level of protection provided depends on the numbers, quality (functional ability), and location of memory CD8 T cells present at the time of infection. While primary memory CD8 T cells can be maintained for the life of the host, the full extent of phenotypic and functional changes that occur over time after initial antigen encounter remains poorly characterized. Here we show that critical properties of circulating primary memory CD8 T cells, including location, phenotype, cytokine production, maintenance, secondary proliferation, secondary memory generation potential, and mitochondrial function change with time after infection. Interestingly, phenotypic and functional alterations in the memory population are not due solely to shifts in the ratio of effector (CD62Llo) and central memory (CD62Lhi) cells, but also occur within defined CD62Lhi memory CD8 T cell subsets. CD62Lhi memory cells retain the ability to efficiently produce cytokines with time after infection. However, while it is was not formally tested whether changes in CD62Lhi memory CD8 T cells over time occur in a cell intrinsic manner or are due to selective death and/or survival, the gene expression profiles of CD62Lhi memory CD8 T cells change, phenotypic heterogeneity decreases, and mitochondrial function and proliferative capacity in either a lymphopenic environment or in response to antigen re-encounter increase with time. Importantly, and in accordance with their enhanced proliferative and metabolic capabilities, protection provided against chronic LCMV clone-13 infection increases over time for both circulating memory CD8 T cell populations and for CD62Lhi memory cells. Taken together, the data in this study reveal that memory CD8 T cells continue to change with time after infection and suggest that the outcome of vaccination strategies designed to elicit protective memory CD8 T cells using single or prime-boost immunizations depends upon the timing between antigen encounters.	2015	Phenotypic and Functional Alterations in Circulating Memory CD8 T Cells with Time after Primary Infection.	26485703	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC4608755	10.1371/journal.pone.0140036	Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare, congenital erythrocyte aplasia that is usually caused by haploinsufficiency of ribosomal proteins due to diverse mutations in one of several ribosomal genes. A striking feature of this disease is that a range of different mutations in ribosomal proteins results in similar disease phenotypes primarily characterized by erythrocyte abnormalities and macrocytic anemia, while most other cell types in the body are minimally affected. Previously, we analyzed the erythrocyte membrane proteomes of several DBA patients and identified several proteins that are not typically associated with this cell type and that suggested inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of DBA. In this study, we evaluated the erythrocyte cytosolic proteome of DBA patients through in-depth analysis of hemoglobin-depleted erythrocyte cytosols. Simple, reproducible, hemoglobin depletion using nickel columns enabled in-depth analysis of over 1000 cytosolic erythrocyte proteins with only moderate total analysis time per proteome. Label-free quantitation and statistical analysis identified 29 proteins with significantly altered abundance levels in DBA patients compared to matched healthy control donors. Proteins that were significantly increased in DBA erythrocyte cytoplasms included three proteasome subunit beta proteins that make up the immunoproteasome and proteins induced by interferon-γ such as n-myc interactor and interferon-induced 35 kDa protein [NMI and IFI35 respectively]. Pathway analysis confirmed the presence of an inflammatory signature in erythrocytes of DBA patients and predicted key upstream regulators including mitogen activated kinase 1, interferon-γ, tumor suppressor p53, and tumor necrosis factor. These results show that erythrocytes in DBA patients are intrinsically different from those in healthy controls which may be due to an inflammatory response resulting from the inherent molecular defect of ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency or changes in the bone marrow microenvironment that leads to red cell aplasia in DBA patients.	2015	In-Depth, Label-Free Analysis of the Erythrocyte Cytoplasmic Proteome in Diamond Blackfan Anemia Identifies a Unique Inflammatory Signature.	26474164	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC9542162	10.1002/cne.25312	The thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) is a structure highly interconnected with several nuclei ranging from forebrain to hypothalamus and brainstem. Numerous rodent studies have examined afferent and efferent connections of the PVT and their contribution to behavior, revealing its important role in the integration of arousal cues. However, the majority of these studies used a region-oriented approach, without considering the neuronal subtype diversity of the nucleus. In the present study, we provide the anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of a subpopulation of PVT neurons molecularly defined by the expression of glucokinase (Gck). Combining a genetically modified mouse model with viral tracing approaches, we mapped both the anterograde and the retrograde projections of Gck-positive neurons of the anterior PVT (Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> ). Our results demonstrated that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons innervate several nuclei throughout the brain axis. The strongest connections are with forebrain areas associated with reward and stress and with hypothalamic structures involved in energy balance and feeding regulation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the Gck-expressing neurons revealed that they are enriched in receptors for hypothalamic-derived neuropeptides, adhesion molecules, and obesity and diabetes susceptibility transcription factors. Using retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we identify that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons receive direct inputs from well-defined hypothalamic populations, including arginine-vasopressin-, melanin-concentrating hormone-, orexin-, and proopiomelanocortin-expressing neurons. This detailed anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons provides a basis for functional studies of the integration of homeostatic and hedonic aspects of energy homeostasis, and for deciphering the potential role of these neurons in obesity and diabetes development.	2022	Structural and molecular characterization of paraventricular thalamic glucokinase-expressing neuronal circuits in the mouse.	35303367	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol
PMC8967306	10.1002/rmb2.12435	<h4>Purpose</h4>The receptive endometrium is critical for blastocyst implantation. In mice, after blastocysts enter the uterine cavities on day 4 of pregnancy (day 1 = vaginal plug), blastocyst attachment is completed within 24 h, accompanied by dynamic interactions between the uterine luminal epithelium and the blastocysts. Any failures in this process compromise subsequent pregnancy outcomes. Here, we performed comprehensive analyses of gene expression at the luminal epithelium in the peri-implantation period.<h4>Methods</h4>RNA-seq combined with laser microdissection (LMD) was used to reveal unique gene expression kinetics in the epithelium.<h4>Results</h4>We found that the prereceptive epithelium on day 3 specifically expresses cell cycle-related genes. In addition, days 3 and 4 epithelia express glutathione pathway-related genes, which are protective against oxidative stresses. In contrast, day 5 epithelium expresses genes involved in glycolysis and the regulation of cell proliferation. The genes highly expressed on days 3 and 4 compared to day 5 are related to progesterone receptor signaling, and the genes highly expressed on day 5 compared to days 3 and 4 are associated with the ones regulated by H3K27me3.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that specific gene expression patterns govern uterine functions during early pregnancy, contributing to implantation success.	2022	A gene network of uterine luminal epithelium organizes mouse blastocyst implantation.	35386370	AAMDC	C11orf67	primary_symbol

While the assembly of the snRNP core particles has been well characterized, comparably little is known of the incorporation of snRNP-specific proteins and the mechanisms of snRNP recycling. U5 snRNP assembly in yeast requires binding of the the Aar2 protein to Prp8p as a placeholder to preclude premature assembly of the SNRNP200 helicase, but the role of the human AAR2 homolog has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, a crystal structure of human AAR2 in complex with the RNase H-like domain of the U5-specific PRPF8 (PRP8F RH) is reported, revealing a significantly different interaction between the two proteins compared with that in yeast. Based on the structure of the AAR2-PRPF8 RH complex, the importance of the interacting regions and residues was probed and AAR2 variants were designed that failed to stably bind PRPF8 in vitro. Protein-interaction studies of AAR2 with U5 proteins using size-exclusion chromatography reveal similarities and marked differences in the interaction patterns compared with yeast Aar2p and imply phosphorylation-dependent regulation of AAR2 reminiscent of that in yeast. It is found that in vitro AAR2 seems to lock PRPF8 RH in a conformation that is only compatible with the first transesterification step of the splicing reaction and blocks a conformational switch to the step 2-like, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-coordinated conformation that is likely during U5 snRNP biogenesis. These findings extend the picture of AAR2 PRP8 interaction from yeast to humans and indicate a function for AAR2 in the spliceosomal assembly process beyond its role as an SNRNP200 placeholder in yeast.	2022	Structural and functional investigation of the human snRNP assembly factor AAR2 in complex with the RNase H-like domain of PRPF8.	36322420	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

While more than 500 human protein kinases are known to collectively mediate phosphorylation of over 290,000 S/T/Y sites, the activities have been characterized only for a minor, intensively studied subset. To systematically address this discrepancy, we developed a human kinase array in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a simple readout tool to systematically assess kinase activities. For this array, we expressed 266 human kinases in four different S. cerevisiae strains and profiled ectopic growth as a proxy for kinase activity across 33 conditions. More than half of the kinases showed an activity-dependent phenotype across many conditions and in more than one strain. We then employed the kinase array to identify the kinase(s) that can modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Two characterized, phosphorylation-dependent PPIs with unknown kinase-substrate relationships were analyzed in a phospho-yeast two-hybrid assay. CK2α1 and SGK2 kinases can abrogate the interaction between the spliceosomal proteins AAR2 and PRPF8, and NEK6 kinase was found to mediate the estrogen receptor (ERα) interaction with 14-3-3 proteins.

Class I RNRs are composed of two proteins, a large α-subunit (R1) and a smaller β-subunit (R2) that exist as homodimers, that combine to form an active heterotetramer. <i>Aquifex aeolicus</i> is a hyperthermophilic bacterium with an unusual RNR encoding a 346-residue intein in the DNA sequence encoding its R2 subunit. We present the first structures of the <i>A. aeolicus</i> R1 and R2 (AaR1 and AaR2, respectively) proteins as well as the biophysical and biochemical characterization of active and inactive <i>A. aeolicus</i> RNR. While the active oligomeric state and activity regulation of <i>A. aeolicus</i> RNR are similar to those of other characterized RNRs, the X-ray crystal structures also reveal distinct features and adaptations. Specifically, AaR1 contains a β-hairpin hook structure at the dimer interface, which has an interesting π-stacking interaction absent in other members of the NrdAh subclass, and its ATP cone houses two ATP molecules. We determined structures of two AaR2 proteins: one purified from a construct lacking the intein (AaR2) and a second purified from a construct including the intein sequence (AaR2_genomic). These structures in the context of metal content analysis and activity data indicate that AaR2_genomic displays much higher iron occupancy and activity compared to AaR2, suggesting that the intein is important for facilitating complete iron incorporation, particularly in the Fe2 site of the mature R2 protein, which may be important for the survival of <i>A. aeolicus</i> in low-oxygen environments.	2022	Structural and Biochemical Investigation of Class I Ribonucleotide Reductase from the Hyperthermophile <i>Aquifex aeolicus</i>.	34941255	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

Excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), above the signaling levels necessary for the correct function of organelles and cells, may contribute to the non-desired effects of oxidative stress. Platelets play a relevant role in arterial thrombosis, by aggregation triggered by different agonists, where excessive ROS formation induces mitochondrial dysfunction and stimulate platelet activation and aggregation. Platelet is both a source and a target of ROS, thus we aim to analyze both the platelet enzymes responsible for ROS generation and their involvement in intracellular signal transduction pathways. Among the proteins involved in these processes are Protein Disulphide Isomerase (PDI) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms. By using bioinformatic tools and information from available databases, a complete bioinformatic analysis of the role and interactions of PDI and NOX in platelets, as well as the signal transduction pathways involved in their effects was performed. We focused the study on analyzing whether these proteins collaborate to control platelet function. The data presented in the current manuscript support the role that PDI and NOX play on activation pathways necessary for platelet activation and aggregation, as well as on the platelet signaling imbalance produced by ROS production. Our data could be used to design specific enzyme inhibitors or a dual inhibition for these enzymes with an antiplatelet effect to design promising treatments for diseases involving platelet dysfunction.	2023	An Overview of Two Old Friends Associated with Platelet Redox Signaling, the Protein Disulfide Isomerase and NADPH Oxidase.	37238717	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC8789047	10.1093/nar/gkab1267	Biogenesis of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) is an essential and highly regulated process. In particular, PRPF8, one of U5 snRNP main components, requires HSP90 working in concert with R2TP, a cochaperone complex containing RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases, and additional factors that are still poorly characterized. Here, we use biochemistry, interaction mapping, mass spectrometry and cryoEM to study the role of ZNHIT2 in the regulation of the R2TP chaperone during the biogenesis of PRPF8. ZNHIT2 forms a complex with R2TP which depends exclusively on the direct interaction of ZNHIT2 with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPases. The cryoEM analysis of this complex reveals that ZNHIT2 alters the conformation and nucleotide state of RUVBL1-RUVBL2, affecting its ATPase activity. We characterized the interactions between R2TP, PRPF8, ZNHIT2, ECD and AAR2 proteins. Interestingly, PRPF8 makes a direct interaction with R2TP and this complex can incorporate ZNHIT2 and other proteins involved in the biogenesis of PRPF8 such as ECD and AAR2. Together, these results show that ZNHIT2 participates in the assembly of the U5 snRNP as part of a network of contacts between assembly factors required for PRPF8 biogenesis and the R2TP-HSP90 chaperone, while concomitantly regulating the structure and nucleotide state of R2TP.	2022	CryoEM of RUVBL1-RUVBL2-ZNHIT2, a complex that interacts with pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8.	34951455	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

By analyzing the expression differences of mRNAs and splicing isoforms, we found that differentially expressed mRNAs with splicing isoforms could participate in skeletal muscle development and fatty acid metabolism, which might determine muscle-related traits. <i>SERBP1</i>, <i>MYL1</i>, <i>TNNT3</i>, and <i>TNNT1</i> were identified with multiple splicing isoforms, with significant differences in expression. AS events occurring in <i>IFI6</i> and <i>GADD45G</i> may cause significant differences in gene expression. Other AS events, such as ONT.15153.3, may regulate the function of <i>ART1</i> by regulating the expression of different transcripts. Moreover, co-expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis indicated that several genes (<i>MRPL27</i>, <i>AAR2</i>, <i>PYGM</i>, <i>PSMD4</i>, <i>SCNM1</i>, and <i>HNRNPDL</i>) may be related to intramuscular fat. The splicing isoforms investigated in our research provide a reference for the study of alternative splicing regulation of intramuscular fat deposition.	2022	Integrative Analysis of Nanopore and Illumina Sequencing Reveals Alternative Splicing Complexity in Pig Longissimus Dorsi Muscle.	35480309	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC9406135	10.3390/biom12081045	Hsp90 is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone involved in many cell signaling pathways, and its interactions with specific chaperones and cochaperones determines which client proteins to fold. Hsp90 has been shown to be involved in the promotion and maintenance of proper protein complex assembly either alone or in association with other chaperones such as the R2TP chaperone complex. Hsp90-R2TP acts through several mechanisms, such as by controlling the transcription of protein complex subunits, stabilizing protein subcomplexes before their incorporation into the entire complex, and by recruiting adaptors that facilitate complex assembly. Despite its many roles in protein complex assembly, detailed mechanisms of how Hsp90-R2TP assembles protein complexes have yet to be determined, with most findings restricted to proteomic analyses and in vitro interactions. This review will discuss our current understanding of the function of Hsp90-R2TP in the assembly, stabilization, and activity of the following seven classes of protein complexes: L7Ae snoRNPs, spliceosome snRNPs, RNA polymerases, PIKKs, MRN, TSC, and axonemal dynein arms.	2022	The Role of Hsp90-R2TP in Macromolecular Complex Assembly and Stabilization.	36008939	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC8934646	10.1093/nar/gkac087	Biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and their recycling after splicing require numerous assembly/recycling factors whose modes of action are often poorly understood. The intrinsically disordered TSSC4 protein has been identified as a nuclear-localized U5 snRNP and U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP assembly/recycling factor, but how TSSC4's intrinsic disorder supports TSSC4 functions remains unknown. Using diverse interaction assays and cryogenic electron microscopy-based structural analysis, we show that TSSC4 employs four conserved, non-contiguous regions to bind the PRPF8 Jab1/MPN domain and the SNRNP200 helicase at functionally important sites. It thereby inhibits SNRNP200 helicase activity, spatially aligns the proteins, coordinates formation of a U5 sub-module and transiently blocks premature interaction of SNRNP200 with at least three other spliceosomal factors. Guided by the structure, we designed a TSSC4 variant that lacks stable binding to the PRPF8 Jab1/MPN domain or SNRNP200 in vitro. Comparative immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry from HEK293 nuclear extract revealed distinct interaction profiles of wild type TSSC4 and the variant deficient in PRPF8/SNRNP200 binding with snRNP proteins, other spliceosomal proteins as well as snRNP assembly/recycling factors and chaperones. Our findings elucidate molecular strategies employed by an intrinsically disordered protein to promote snRNP assembly, and suggest multiple TSSC4-dependent stages during snRNP assembly/recycling.	2022	The intrinsically disordered TSSC4 protein acts as a helicase inhibitor, placeholder and multi-interaction coordinator during snRNP assembly and recycling.	35188580	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC9980286	10.1155/2023/4967544	Yiqi Yangyin Decoction (YYD) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation to treat lung cancer in clinic. Nevertheless, the active ingredients, key targets, and molecular mechanisms for YYD are still poorly understood. This study is focused on elucidating the pharmacological mechanism of YYD in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by using a combined network pharmacology approach and biological experiment validation. Online bioinformatics tools showed that 40 bioactive compounds and 229 putative targets of YYD were associated with anti-NSCLC activity. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network demonstrated AKT1, SRC, JUN, TP53, and EGFR as the top five key targets for YYD against NSCLC. Through enrichment analysis, YYD was found to affect cell proliferation and apoptosis in NSCLC possibly by PI3K-AKT signaling. Molecular docking confirmed a strong binding between the main compounds (quercetin or luteolin) and EGFR. As demonstrated by CCK-8, EdU, and colony formation assays, we found a significant inhibition of YYD on cell proliferation. Moreover, YYD treatment induced cell cycle arrest by affecting p53, p21, and cyclin D1 expression. YYD administration enhanced apoptosis by changing the expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2. Mechanistically, YYD resulted in a significant inactivation of EGFR-PI3K-AKT signaling. Furthermore, EGFR activator significantly reversed YYD-mediated proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. YYD also showed an inhibitory effect on tumor growth in mice. Together, YYD might target the EGFR-PI3K-AKT pathway to repress NSCLC progression.	2023	Integrating Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation to Elucidate the Mechanism of Yiqi Yangyin Decoction in Suppressing Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.	36874921	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC8840177	10.3390/plants11030300	There is a significant need to gain access to new and better antibacterial agents. Acalypha arvensis, a plant from the Euphorbiaceae family, has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat infectious diseases. This manuscript reports the isolation, characterization, and antibacterial screening of 8 natural products extracted from maceration of aerial parts of Acalypha arvensis. Specifically, three extracts were assessed (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol), in which antibacterial activity was evaluated against diverse bacterial strains. The ethanolic extract showed the best activity against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, which supports the medicinal properties attributed to this plant. The chromatographic fractions AaR4 and AaR5 were the most bioactive, in which the ellagitannin natural product known as corilagin (1) was identified for the first time in this plant. Therefore, it can be said that this is the main chemical responsible for the observed antibacterial activity. However, we also identified chlorogenic acid (2), rutin (3), quercetin-3-O-glucoside (4), caffeic acid (5), among others (6-8). Hence, this plant can be considered to be a good alternative to treat health-related issues caused by various bacteria.	2022	Ellagitannin, Phenols, and Flavonoids as Antibacterials from Acalypha arvensis (Euphorbiaceae). 	35161281	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC7685122	10.1002/jgm.3259	<h4>Background</h4>pH-sensitive peptides are a relatively new strategy for conquering the poor endosomal release of cationic polymer-mediated transfection. Modification of antimicrobial peptides by exchanging positively-charged residues with negatively-charged glutamic acid residues (Glu) greatly improves its lytic activity at the endosomal pH, which could improve cationic polymer-mediated transfection.<h4>Methods</h4>In the present study, we investigated the effect of the number of Glu substituted for positively-charged residues on the endosomal escape activity of AR-23 and the ability of mutated AR-23 with respect to enhancing cationic polymer-mediated transfection. Three analogs were synthesized by replacing the positively-charged residues in the AR-23 sequence with Glu one-by-one.<h4>Results</h4>The pH-sensitive lysis ability of the peptides, the effect of peptides on the physicochemical characteristics, the intracellular trafficking, the transfection efficiency and the cytotoxicity of the polyplexes were determined. Increased lytic activity of peptides was observed with the increased number of Glu replacement in the AR-23 sequence at acidic pH. The number of Glu substituted for positively-charged residues of AR-23 dramatically affects its lysis ability at neutral pH. Triple-Glu substitution in the AR-23 sequence greatly improved poly(l-lysine)-mediated gene transfection efficiency at the same time as maintaining low cytotoxicity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results indicate that replacement of positively-charged residues with sufficient Glu residues may be considered as a method for designing pH-sensitive peptides, which could be applied as potential enhancers for improving cationic polymer-mediated transfection.	2020	Antimicrobial peptide AR-23 derivatives with high endosomal disrupting ability enhance poly(l-lysine)-mediated gene transfer.	32776410	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC9864873	10.3390/plants12020342	MicroRNAs are small RNAs, 20-22 nt long, the main role of which is to downregulate gene expression at the level of mRNAs. MiRNAs are fundamental regulators of plant growth and development in response to internal signals as well as in response to abiotic and biotic factors. Therefore, the deficiency or excess of individual miRNAs is detrimental to particular aspects of a plant's life. In consequence, the miRNA levels must be appropriately adjusted. To obtain proper expression of each miRNA, their biogenesis is controlled at multiple regulatory layers. Here, we addressed processes discovered to influence miRNA steady-state levels, such as <i>MIR</i> transcription, co-transcriptional pri-miRNA processing (including splicing, polyadenylation, microprocessor assembly and activity) and miRNA-encoded peptides synthesis. MiRNA stability, RISC formation and miRNA export out of the nucleus and out of the plant cell also define the levels of miRNAs in various plant tissues. Moreover, we show the evolutionary conservation of miRNA biogenesis core proteins across the plant kingdom.	2023	Recent Insights into Plant miRNA Biogenesis: Multiple Layers of miRNA Level Regulation.	36679055	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC8206348	10.1038/s41467-021-23934-y	U5 snRNP is a complex particle essential for RNA splicing. U5 snRNPs undergo intricate biogenesis that ensures that only a fully mature particle assembles into a splicing competent U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP and enters the splicing reaction. During splicing, U5 snRNP is substantially rearranged and leaves as a U5/PRPF19 post-splicing particle, which requires re-generation before the next round of splicing. Here, we show that a previously uncharacterized protein TSSC4 is a component of U5 snRNP that promotes tri-snRNP formation. We provide evidence that TSSC4 associates with U5 snRNP chaperones, U5 snRNP and the U5/PRPF19 particle. Specifically, TSSC4 interacts with U5-specific proteins PRPF8, EFTUD2 and SNRNP200. We also identified TSSC4 domains critical for the interaction with U5 snRNP and the PRPF19 complex, as well as for TSSC4 function in tri-snRNP assembly. TSSC4 emerges as a specific chaperone that acts in U5 snRNP de novo biogenesis as well as post-splicing recycling.	2021	TSSC4 is a component of U5 snRNP that promotes tri-snRNP formation.	34131137	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC9887622	10.1093/molbev/msad011	Eukaryotic genes are characterized by the presence of introns that are removed from pre-mRNA by a spliceosome. This ribonucleoprotein complex is comprised of multiple RNA molecules and over a hundred proteins, which makes it one of the most complex molecular machines that originated during the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition. Previous works have established that these introns and the spliceosomal core originated from self-splicing introns in prokaryotes. Yet, how the spliceosomal core expanded by recruiting many additional proteins remains largely elusive. In this study, we use phylogenetic analyses to infer the evolutionary history of 145 proteins that we could trace back to the spliceosome in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. We found that an overabundance of proteins derived from ribosome-related processes was added to the prokaryote-derived core. Extensive duplications of these proteins substantially increased the complexity of the emerging spliceosome. By comparing the intron positions between spliceosomal paralogs, we infer that most spliceosomal complexity postdates the spread of introns through the proto-eukaryotic genome. The reconstruction of early spliceosomal evolution provides insight into the driving forces behind the emergence of complexes with many proteins during eukaryogenesis.	2023	Integrating Phylogenetics With Intron Positions Illuminates the Origin of the Complex Spliceosome.	36631250	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC10070826	10.3389/fendo.2023.1095432	<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Obesity is a global health problem with few pharmacologic options. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that induces weight loss. Yet, the role of semaglutide in adipose tissue has not yet been examined. The following study investigated the mechanism of semaglutide on lipid metabolism by analyzing proteomics of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) in obese mice.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 36 C57BL/6JC mice were randomly divided into a normal-chow diet group (NCD, n = 12), high-fat diet (HFD, n = 12), and HFD+semaglutide group (Sema, n = 12). Mice in the Sema group were intraperitoneally administered semaglutide, and the HFD group and the NCD group were intraperitoneally administered an equal volume of normal saline. Serum samples were collected to detect fasting blood glucose and blood lipids. The Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was used to measure the blood glucose value at each time point and calculate the area under the glucose curve. Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to study the expression of eWAT, while cellular processes, biological processes, corresponding molecular functions, and related network molecular mechanisms were analyzed by bioinformatics.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with the model group, the semaglutide-treated mice presented 640 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 292 up-regulated and 348 down-regulated proteins. Bioinformatics analysis showed a reduction of CD36, FABP5, ACSL, ACOX3, PLIN2, ANGPTL4, LPL, MGLL, AQP7, and PDK4 involved in the lipid metabolism in the Sema group accompanied by a decrease in visceral fat accumulation, blood lipids, and improvement in glucose intolerance.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Semaglutide can effectively reduce visceral fat and blood lipids and improve glucose metabolism in obese mice. Semaglutide treatment might have beneficial effects on adipose tissues through the regulation of lipid uptake, lipid storage, and lipolysis in white adipose tissue.	2023	Proteomic analysis reveals semaglutide impacts lipogenic protein expression in epididymal adipose tissue of obese mice.	37025414	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
NA	10.1016/j.str.2020.04.019	Crystallographic fragment screening (CFS) provides excellent starting points for projects concerned with drug discovery or biochemical tool compound development. One of the fundamental prerequisites for effective CFS is the availability of a versatile fragment library. Here, we report on the assembly of the 1,103-compound F2X-Universal Library and its 96-compound sub-selection, the F2X-Entry Screen. Both represent the available fragment chemistry and are highly diverse in terms of their 3D-pharmacophore variations. Validation of the F2X-Entry Screen in CFS campaigns using endothiapepsin and the Aar2/RNaseH complex yielded hit rates of 30% and 21%, respectively, and revealed versatile binding sites. Dry presentation of the libraries allows CFS campaigns to be carried out with or without the co-solvent DMSO present. Most of the hits in our validation campaigns could be reproduced also in the absence of DMSO. Consequently, CFS can be carried out more efficiently and for a wider range of conditions and targets.	2020	F2X-Universal and F2X-Entry: Structurally Diverse Compound Libraries for Crystallographic Fragment Screening.	32413289	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

We downloaded 49 samples from Gene Expression Omnibus and identified candidate ERGs using differentially expressed ERGs (De-ERGs), exosome-related gene pairs (ERGPs), and machine learning algorithms [least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine (SVM)]. Immune cell-related ERGs were selected <i>via</i> immune-infiltration analysis, and clinical values were assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Based on the De-ERGs, a ceRNA network comprising 1,512 links and 330 nodes was constructed and primarily related to signal transduction pathways, apoptosis-related biological processes, and multiple kinase-related molecular functions. In total, two crucial De-ERGs [angio-associated migratory cell protein (AAMP) and 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT)] were screened from results in De-ERGs, ERGPs, LASSO, and SVM. Increased <i>AAMP</i> expression and decreased <i>ABAT</i> expression were positively and negatively correlated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, respectively. <i>AAMP</i>/<i>ABAT</i> was the only pair differentially expressed in IDD and correlated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration.

Yet, the ongoing neurodegenerative process is still ambiguous, under-assessed, and probably under-treated. Atrophy and cognitive dysfunction represent the radiological and clinical correlates of such process. In this study, we evaluated the effect of one specific MS treatment, which is natalizumab (NTZ), on brain atrophy evolution in different anatomical regions and its correlation with the cognitive profile and the physical disability.<h4>Methods</h4>We recruited 20 patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) and treated with NTZ. We tracked brain atrophy in different anatomical structures using MRI scans processed with an automated image segmentation technique. We also assessed the progression of physical disability and the cognitive function and its link with the progression of atrophy.<h4>Results</h4>During the first 2 years of treatment, a significant volume loss was noted within the corpus callosum and the cerebellum gray matter (GM). The annual atrophy rate of the cortical GM, the cerebellum GM, the thalamus, the amygdala, the globus pallidus, and the hippocampus correlated with greater memory impairment. As for the third and fourth years of treatment, a significant atrophy revolved around the gray matter, mainly the cortical one. We also noted an increase of the thalamus volume.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Atrophy in RR-MS patients treated with NTZ is regional and targeting highly cognitive regions mainly of the subcortical gray matter and the cerebellum. The cerebellum atrophy was a marker of physical disability progression. NTZ did not accelerate the atrophy process in MS and may play a neuroprotective role by increasing the thalamus volume.	2022	Brain atrophy patterns in multiple sclerosis patients treated with natalizumab and its clinical correlates.	35398999	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC7192624	10.1093/nar/gkaa182	The single G protein of the spliceosome, Snu114, has been proposed to facilitate splicing as a molecular motor or as a regulatory G protein. However, available structures of spliceosomal complexes show Snu114 in the same GTP-bound state, and presently no Snu114 GTPase-regulatory protein is known. We determined a crystal structure of Snu114 with a Snu114-binding region of the Prp8 protein, in which Snu114 again adopts the same GTP-bound conformation seen in spliceosomes. Snu114 and the Snu114-Prp8 complex co-purified with endogenous GTP. Snu114 exhibited weak, intrinsic GTPase activity that was abolished by the Prp8 Snu114-binding region. Exchange of GTP-contacting residues in Snu114, or of Prp8 residues lining the Snu114 GTP-binding pocket, led to temperature-sensitive yeast growth and affected the same set of splicing events in vivo. Consistent with dynamic Snu114-mediated protein interactions during splicing, our results suggest that the Snu114-GTP-Prp8 module serves as a relay station during spliceosome activation and disassembly, but that GTPase activity may be dispensable for splicing.	2020	A Snu114-GTP-Prp8 module forms a relay station for efficient splicing in yeast.	32196113	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC9893293	10.3389/fpls.2023.1096772	In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) associate with ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins and act as sequence-specific repressors of target gene expression, at the post-transcriptional level through target transcript cleavage and/or translational inhibition. MiRNAs are mainly transcribed by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (POL II) and processed by DICER LIKE1 (DCL1) complex into 21∼22 nucleotide (nt) long. Although the main molecular framework of miRNA biogenesis and modes of action have been established, there are still new requirements continually emerging in the recent years. The studies on the involvement factors in miRNA biogenesis indicate that miRNA biogenesis is not accomplished separately step by step, but is closely linked and dynamically regulated with each other. In this article, we will summarize the current knowledge on miRNA biogenesis, including <i>MIR</i> gene transcription, primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) processing, miRNA AGO1 loading and nuclear export; and miRNA metabolism including methylation, uridylation and turnover.

Eight healthy conjunctival specimens served as controls. The TME of CM, as determined by bioinformatic cell type enrichment analysis, was characterized by the enrichment of melanocytes, pericytes and especially various immune cell types, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, B cells and mast cells. Differentially expressed genes between CM and control were mainly involved in inhibition of apoptosis, proteolysis and response to growth factors. POU3F3, BIRC5 and 7 were among the top expressed genes associated with inhibition of apoptosis. 20 genes, among them CENPK, INHA, USP33, CASP3, SNORA73B, AAR2, SNRNP48 and GPN1, were identified as prognostically relevant factors reaching high classification accuracy (area under the curve: 1.0). The present study provides new insights into the TME and the transcriptional profile of CM and additionally identifies new prognostic biomarkers.

Limited information on tick feeding behaviors hampers development and rigorous evaluation of tick and tick-borne pathogen control measures. To address this obstacle, the present study examined the utility of AC-DC electropenetrography (EPG) to monitor feeding behaviors of adult Dermacentor variabilis and Amblyomma americanum in real-time. EPG recording was performed during early stages of slow-phase tick feeding using an awake calf host. Both tick species exhibited discernable and stereotypical waveforms of low-, medium-, and high-frequencies. Similar waveform families and types were observed for both tick species; however, species-specific waveform structural differences were also observed. Tick waveforms were hierarchically categorized into three families containing seven types. Some waveform types were conserved by both species (e.g., Types 1b, 1c, 2b, 2c) while others were variably performed among species and individually recorded ticks (e.g., Types 1a, 2a, 2d). This study provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the feasibility for using EPG to monitor, evaluate, and compare tick feeding behaviors, providing a foundation for future studies aimed at correlating specific feeding behaviors with waveforms, and ultimately the influence of control measures and pathogens on tick feeding behaviors.	2021	AC-DC electropenetrography unmasks fine temporal details of feeding behaviors for two tick species on unsedated hosts.	33479263	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

The aim of this study was to develop computational methods to more effectively identify at-risk patients and, thereby, support better early interventions.<h4>Methods</h4>We proposed machine learning (ML) induction of models to automatically predict elevated PTSD symptoms in patients 1 month after a trauma, using self-reported symptoms from data collected via smartphones.<h4>Results</h4>We show that an ensemble model accurately predicts elevated PTSD symptoms, with an area under the curve (AUC) of .85, using a bag of support vector machines, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and random forest algorithms. Furthermore, we show that only 7 self-reported items (features) are needed to obtain this AUC. Most importantly, we show that accurate predictions can be made 10 to 20 days posttrauma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that simple smartphone-based patient surveys, coupled with automated analysis using ML-trained models, can identify those at risk for developing elevated PTSD symptoms and thus target them for early intervention.	2019	Predicting Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Risk: A Machine Learning Approach.	31333201	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

GEJ cancer frequently metastasizes to lymph nodes, however the heterogeneity and clonal evolution process are unclear. This study is the first of this kind to use single cell DNA sequencing to determine genomic variations and clonal evolution related to lymph node metastasis. Multiple Annealing and Looping Based Amplification Cycles (MALBAC) and bulk exome sequencing were performed to detect single cell copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide variations (SNVs) respectively. Four GEJ cancer patients were enrolled with two (Pt.3, Pt.4) having metastatic lymph nodes. The most common mutation we found happened in the TTN gene, which was reported to be related with the tumor mutation burden in cancers. Significant intra-patient heterogeneity in SNVs and CNVs were found. We identified the SNV subclonal architecture in each tumor. To study the heterogeneity of CNVs, the single cells were sequenced. The number of subclones in the primary tumor was larger than that in lymph nodes, indicating the heterogeneity of primary site was higher. We observed two patterns of multi-station lymph node metastasis: one was skip metastasis and the other was to follow the lymphatic drainage. Taken together, our single cell genomic analysis has revealed the heterogeneity and clonal evolution in GEJ cancer.	2021	Genomic Heterogeneity and Clonal Evolution in Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer Revealed by Single Cell DNA Sequencing.	34046362	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

PMC9384010	NA	Abstract <h4>Background</h4> SARS–CoV–2 primarily affects the respiratory system, but cardiac complications also occur very often. The entry of SARS–CoV–2 into host cells is mediated by the interaction between the viral glycoprotein Spike (S) and the host angiotensin–converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. The use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) might influence both ACE2 expression and viral infection, but our knowledge about these possible interactions is limited. Aim. To evaluate the effects of ACEIs and ARBs during active viraemia. <h4>Methods</h4> We tested the effects of exposure to the ACEI Lisinopril (100nM and 500nM) and the ARB Valsartan (10µM and 50µM) on three different cell types: green monkey–derived epithelial cells (VERO E6) which are used to replicate SARS–CoV–2, cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSC (iPSC–CMs) as heart model and a lung epithelial cancer cell line (16HBE) as pulmonary model. The SARS–CoV–2 wild strain was inoculated on cell lines for 1 hour. Cell viability was measured 72 hours after infection. The supernatants of the infected cells were collected and titrated by the micro–neutralization assay on VERO E6 cells to verify the presence of the virus. Levels of ACE2 mRNA and protein content on cell lysates were quantified after each treatment by RT–qPCR and western blot, respectively. <h4>Results</h4> ACEI and ARB at both concentrations do not affect the viability of the 3 cell lines. Vice versa, viral infection significantly decreases the viability of VERO E6 (–60%, p < 0.0001) and iPSC–CMs (–44%, p < 0.001), while 16HBE cells do not show a cytopathic effect after infection. Viral titration shows that SARS–CoV–2 replicated in cell lines and was actively released into supernatants. Valsartan 50µM decreased virus release in the three cell lines and increased the viability of VERO E6 (+69%, p < 0.01) and iPSC–CMs (+20.5%, p < 0.05) after the infection. Valsartan 50µM also decreases both mRNA (–65% in VERO E6, p < 0.001; –50% in iPSC–CMs, p < 0.05; –60.5% in 16HBE, p < 0.01) and protein levels of ACE2 in all 3 cell lines. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The data suggest that ACEIs and ARBs do not worsen the SARS–CoV–2 infection and that Valsartan, by reducing the levels of ACE2 expression, might result protective.	2022	P182 VALSARTAN LIMITS PULMONARY AND CARDIAC DAMAGE INDUCED BY SARS–COV–2 IN EXPERIMENTAL MODELS BY REDUCING THE EXPRESSION OF ACE2	NA	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC7993677	10.18632/aging.202725	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease with a poor prognosis. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shares some similarities with IPF. SARS-CoV-2 related genes have been reported to be broadly regulated by N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) RNA modification. Here, we identified the association between m<sup>6</sup>A methylation regulators, COVID-19 infection pathways, and immune responses in IPF. The characteristic gene expression networks and immune infiltration patterns of m<sup>6</sup>A-SARS-CoV-2 related genes in different tissues of IPF were revealed. We subsequently evaluated the influence of these related gene expression patterns and immune infiltration patterns on the prognosis/lung function of IPF patients. The IPF cohort was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the correlations among genes or cells. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to assess the infiltration of 22 types of immune cells. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and proportional hazards model (Cox model) were used to develop the prognosis prediction model. Our research is pivotal for further understanding of the cellular and genetic links between IPF and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may contribute to providing new ideas for prognosis assessment and treatment of both diseases.	2021	The networks of m<sup>6</sup>A-SARS-CoV-2 related genes and immune infiltration patterns in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.	33647885	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC9865824	10.3390/plants12020412	Soil salinity is a serious threat to food production now and in the near future. In this study, the root system of six durum wheat genotypes, including one highly salt-tolerant (J. Khetifa) used as a check genotype, was evaluated, by a high-throughput phenotyping system, under control and salt conditions at the seedling stage. Genotyping was performed using 11 SSR markers closely linked with genome regions associated with root traits. Based on phenotypic cluster analysis, genotypes were grouped differently under control and salt conditions. Under control conditions, genotypes were clustered mainly due to a root angle, while under salt stress, genotypes were grouped according to their capacity to maintain higher roots length, volume, and surface area, as J. Khetifa, Sebatel, and Azeghar. SSR analysis identified a total of 42 alleles, with an average of about three alleles per marker. Moreover, quite a high number of Private alleles in total, 18 were obtained. The UPGMA phenogram of the Nei (1972) genetic distance clusters for 11 SSR markers and all phenotypic data under control conditions discriminate genotypes almost into the same groups. The study revealed as the combination of high-throughput systems for phenotyping with SSR markers for genotyping it's a useful tool to provide important data for the selection of suitable parental lines for salt-tolerance breeding. Nevertheless, the narrow root angle, which is an important trait in drought tolerance, is not a good indicator of salt tolerance. Instated for salt tolerance is more important the amount of roots.	2023	Phenotypic and Genotypic Diversity of Roots Response to Salt in Durum Wheat Seedlings.	36679125	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC5461031	10.1083/jcb.201701165	Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of five major small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). The pre-mRNA splicing factor PRPF8 is a crucial component of the U5 snRNP, and together with EFTUD2 and SNRNP200, it forms a central module of the spliceosome. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified assembly intermediates containing PRPF8, EFTUD2, and SNRNP200 in association with the HSP90/R2TP complex, its ZNHIT2 cofactor, and additional proteins. HSP90 and R2TP bind unassembled U5 proteins in the cytoplasm, stabilize them, and promote the formation of the U5 snRNP. We further found that PRPF8 mutants causing Retinitis pigmentosa assemble less efficiently with the U5 snRNP and bind more strongly to R2TP, with one mutant retained in the cytoplasm in an R2TP-dependent manner. We propose that the HSP90/R2TP chaperone system promotes the assembly of a key module of U5 snRNP while assuring the quality control of PRPF8. The proteomics data further reveal new interactions between R2TP and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), pointing to a potential link between growth signals and the assembly of key cellular machines.	2017	Assembly of the U5 snRNP component PRPF8 is controlled by the HSP90/R2TP chaperones.	28515276	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC9662024	10.15698/mic2022.11.786	The emergence of drug resistance significantly hampers the treatment of human infections, including those caused by fungal pathogens such as <i>Candida</i> species. <i>Candida glabrata</i> ranks as the second most common cause of candidiasis worldwide, supported by rapid acquisition of resistance to azole and echinocandin antifungals frequently prompted by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in resistance associated genes, such as <i>PDR1</i> (azole resistance) or <i>FKS1/2</i> (echinocandin resistance). To determine the frequency of polymorphisms and genome rearrangements as the possible genetic basis of <i>C. glabrata</i> drug resistance, we assessed genomic variation across 94 globally distributed isolates with distinct resistance phenotypes, whose sequence is deposited in GenBank. The genomes of three additional clinical isolates were sequenced, in this study, including two azole resistant strains that did not display Gain-Of-Function (GOF) mutations in the transcription factor encoding gene <i>PDR1</i>. Genomic variations in susceptible isolates were used to screen out variants arising from genome diversity and to identify variants exclusive to resistant isolates. More than half of the azole or echinocandin resistant isolates do not possess exclusive polymorphisms in <i>PDR1</i> or <i>FKS1/2</i>, respectively, providing evidence of alternative genetic basis of antifungal resistance. We also identified copy number variations consistently affecting a subset of chromosomes. Overall, our analysis of the genomic and phenotypic variation across isolates allowed to pinpoint, in a genome-wide scale, genetic changes enriched specifically in antifungal resistant strains, which provides a first step to identify additional determinants of antifungal resistance. Specifically, regarding the newly sequenced strains, a set of mutations/genes are proposed to underlie the observed unconventional azole resistance phenotype.	2022	Multiple genome analysis of <i>Candida glabrata</i> clinical isolates renders new insights into genetic diversity and drug resistance determinants.	36448018	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC7019181	10.3389/fbioe.2020.00045	The broad spectrum of intellectual disability (ID) patients' clinical manifestations, the heterogeneity of ID genetic variation, and the diversity of the phenotypic variation represent major challenges for ID diagnosis. By exploiting a manually curated systematic phenotyping cohort of 3803 patients harboring ID, we identified 704 pathogenic genes, 3848 pathogenic sites, and 2075 standard phenotypes for underlying molecular perturbations and their phenotypic impact. We found the positive correlation between the number of phenotypes and that of patients that revealed their extreme heterogeneities, and the relative contribution of multiple determinants to the heterogeneity of ID phenotypes. Nevertheless, despite the extreme heterogeneity in phenotypes, the ID genes had a specific bias of mutation types, and the top 44 genes that ranked by the number of patients accounted for 39.9% of total patients. More interesting, enriched co-occurrent phenotypes and co-occurrent phenotype networks for each gene had the potential for prioritizing ID genes, further exhibited the convergences of ID phenotypes. Then we established a predictor called IDpred using machine learning methods for ID pathogenic genes prediction. Using10-fold cross-validation, our evaluation shows remarkable AUC values for IDpred (auc = 0.978), demonstrating the robustness and reliability of our tool. Besides, we built the most comprehensive database of ID phenotyped cohort to date: IDminer http://218.4.234.74:3100/IDminer/, which included the curated ID data and integrated IDpred tool for both clinical and experimental researchers. The IDminer serves as an important resource and user-friendly interface to help researchers investigate ID data, and provide important implications for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of developmental disorders of cognition.	2020	Gene-Focused Networks Underlying Phenotypic Convergence in a Systematically Phenotyped Cohort With Heterogeneous Intellectual Disability.	32117926	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC4631593	10.1107/s2053230x15019202	In eukaryotes, the removal of nuclear noncoding sequences (pre-mRNA splicing) is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which consists of five ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs, each with a respective snRNA) and a plethora of protein factors that aid spliceosomal maturation, assembly, activation and disassembly. Recently, the U5 snRNP maturation factor Aar2p from baker's yeast has been characterized structurally and biochemically. Aar2p binds to the RNaseH (RH) and Jab1/MPN domains of the highly conserved U5-specific Prp8p, which forms a framework for the spliceosomal catalytic centre. Thereby, Aar2p sterically excludes Brr2p, a helicase essential for the catalytic activation of the spliceosome, from Prp8p binding. At the same time, Aar2p blocks U4/U6 di-snRNA binding to Prp8p. Aar2p therefore prevents premature spliceosome activation and its functions are regulated by reversible phosphorylation. To date, little is known about the hypothetical human Aar2 (hsAar2) orthologue C20ORF4. This study identifies C20ORF4 (i) as part of the HeLa proteome by Western blotting and (ii) as a true Aar2 orthologue which binds to the RH domain (hsRH) of Prp8 and corroborates an evolutionary link between yeast and human Aar2 function. An elaborate strategy was devised to crystallize hsAar2 in complex with hsRH. The analysis of initial weakly diffracting crystals obtained by in situ proteolysis and homology modelling guided the design of an hsAar2 construct in which an internal loop was replaced by three serines (hsAar2(Δloop)). A complex of hsAar2(Δloop) and hsRH crystallized in space group C2; the crystals diffracted to 2.35 Å resolution and were suitable for structure determination by molecular-replacement approaches. The study presented here suggests a connection between Aar2 and the spliceosome in human cells and paves the way for structural studies of human Aar2.	2015	Crystallization and biochemical characterization of the human spliceosomal Aar2-Prp8(RNaseH) complex.	26527271	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

Previously bulk transcriptome analysis was utilized to identify key genes correlated with the development, progression and prognosis of GC. However, due to the complexity of the genetic mutations, there is still an urgent need to recognize core genes in the regulatory network of GC. <b>Methods:</b> Gene expression profiles (GSE66229) were retrieved from the GEO database. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify gene modules mostly correlated with GC carcinogenesis. R package 'DiffCorr' was applied to identify differentially correlated gene pairs in tumor and normal tissues.

PMC8698607	10.3390/biomedicines9121820	Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) homeostasis plays an important role in maintaining vascular function, and PVAT dysfunction may induce several pathophysiological situations. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of the local angiotensin II (Ang II) on PVAT. High-throughput comparative proteomic analysis, based on TMT labeling combined with LC-MS/MS, were performed on an in vivo Ang II infusion mice model to obtain a comprehensive view of the protein ensembles associated with thoracic PVAT (tPVAT) dysfunction induced by Ang II. In total, 5037 proteins were confidently identified, of which 4984 proteins were quantified. Compared with the saline group, 145 proteins were upregulated and 146 proteins were downregulated during Ang II-induced tPVAT pathogenesis. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the most enriched GO terms were annotated as gene silencing, monosaccharide binding, and extracellular matrix. In addition, some novel proteins, potentially associated with Ang II infusion, were identified, such as acyl-CoA carboxylase α, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSVL), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), perilipin, RAS protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 2 (RasGRF2), and hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Ang II could directly participate in the regulation of lipid metabolism, transportation, and adipocyte differentiation by affecting UCP1 and perilipin. Importantly, the key KEGG pathways were involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, FABP3-PPARα/γ, RasGRF2-ERK-HIF-1α, RasGRF2-PKC-HIF-1α, and STAT3-HIF-1α axis. The present study provided the most comprehensive proteome profile of mice tPVAT and some novel insights into Ang II-mediated tPVAT dysfunction and will be helpful for understanding the possible relationship between local RAS activation and PVAT dysfunction.	2021	Comparative Proteomic Analysis of tPVAT during Ang II Infusion. 	34944635	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

However, few studies have explored the association between the expression of DLGAPs and different types of cancer. Therefore, the present study analyzed the status of DLGAPs in gastric cancer (GC) using bioinformatic tools. Analyses of data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases revealed that there was selective upregulation of DLGAP4 and DLGAP5 expression in GC tissues when compared with normal gastric tissues. In addition, survival analysis using OncoLnc indicated that high expression of DLGAP4 was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival for all GC patients. However, Kaplan‑Meier plots demonstrated that the expression of all DLGAPs, except for DLGAP3, was correlated with patient prognosis; DLGAP4 was consistently associated with GC. DLGAP4 mRNA and protein distributions were examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemsitry. Furthermore, its mutation rate and associated biological processes and signaling pathways were assessed in GC with cBioPortal and FunRich analyses. Taken together, these results indicated that DLGAP4 may serve an oncogenic role in GC development and may be a monitoring target for GC prognosis.	2018	Examination of the expression and prognostic significance of DLGAPs in gastric cancer using the TCGA database and bioinformatic analysis.	30365066	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC8804221	10.3389/fcimb.2021.769026	"Tick saliva, an essential chemical secretion of the tick salivary gland, is indispensable for tick survival owing to the physiological influence it exerts on the host defence mechanisms <i>via</i> the instrumentality of its cocktail of pharmacologically active molecules (proteins and peptides). Much research about tick salivary proteome has been performed, but how most of the individual salivary proteins are utilized by ticks to facilitate blood acquisition and pathogen transmission is not yet fully understood. In addition, the phosphorylation of some proteins plays a decisive role in their function. However, due to the low phosphorylation level of protein, especially for a small amount of protein, it is more difficult to study phosphorylation. Maybe, for this reason, the scarcity of works on the phosphorylated tick salivary proteomes still abound. Here, we performed a phosphoproteomic analysis of <i>Haemaphysalis longicornis</i> tick saliva <i>via</i> TiO<sub>2</sub> enrichment and the most advanced Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer for identification. A total of 262 phosphorylated tick saliva proteins were identified and were subjected to functional annotation/enrichment analysis. Cellular and metabolic process terms accounted for the largest proportion of the saliva proteins, with the participation of these proteins in vital intracellular and extracellular transport-oriented processes such as vesicle-mediated transport, exocytic process, cell adhesion, and movement of cell/subcellular component. ""Endocytosis"", ""Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum"", and ""Purine metabolism"" were the most significantly enriched pathways. The knockdown (RNAi) of Tudor domain-containing protein (TCP), actin-depolymerizing factors (ADF), programmed cell death protein (PD), and serine/threonine-protein kinase (SPK) resulted in the dissociation of collagen fibers and the pilosebaceous unit, increased inflammatory infiltrates/granulocytes (possibly heterophiles), and the depletion of the epithelium. Ticks injected with SPK dsRNA engorged normally but with a change in skin colour (possibly an autoimmune reaction) and the failure to produce eggs pointing to a possible role of SPK in reproduction and host immune modulation. Ticks injected with ADF dsRNA failed to acquire blood, underscoring the role of ADF in facilitating tick feeding. The results of this study showed the presence of phosphorylation in tick saliva and highlight the roles of salivary phosphoproteins in facilitating tick feeding."	2021	Phosphoproteomic Analysis of <i>Haemaphysalis longicornis</i> Saliva Reveals the Influential Contributions of Phosphoproteins to Blood-Feeding Success.	35118006	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

Functional annotation was profiled using GSEA and NET-GE. Target genes within cytobands of interest were screened in silico and validated in vitro using proliferation assays in A498 and 786-O ccRCC cells.<h4>Results</h4>Four TKIs (Sunitinib, Cabozantinib, Axitinib and Sorafenib) that were clinically used in ccRCC were selected. In silico analysis showed gain of 20q (+20q) occurred in ~ 23% of cases and was associated with resistance to all four TKIs; loss of 14q (-14q) occurred in ~ 39% of cases and was associated with resistance to Sunitinib and Sorafenib; loss of 18p (-18p) occurred in ~ 39% of cases and was associated with sensitivity to Sunitinib and Sorafenib.

However, resistance to chemotherapeutic agents has become a major problem, leading to treatment failure. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating acquired resistance to cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF) combination-based chemotherapy in GC patients.<h4>Methods</h4>The microarray datasets (GSE14209, GSE30070) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) using the limma package in R/Bioconductor. Possible targets of the DEMs were predicted using miRWalk, and the putative miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were then conducted and visualized using the Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) and Cytoscape. The prognostic value of hub genes was revealed by Kaplan-Meier Plotter. The causal relationships and interactions between proteins were displayed using DisNor. Finally, similarity analysis was conducted using the Connectivity Map (CMap) profiles to predict a group of small molecules in GC treatment.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 394 DEGs and 31 DEMs were identified after analysis of pre- and post-treatment samples of clinical responders to CF therapy. TM9SF4, hsa-miR-185-5p, and hsa-miR-145-5p were found to be critical in the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. The DEGs were found to be mainly enriched in the processes of ribonucleoprotein complex assembly, catalytic activity acting on RNA, mitochondrial matrix, and thermogenesis. The DEMs were predominantly found to be involved in single-stranded RNA binding and endoplasmic reticulum lumen. HDAC5, DDX17, ILF3, and SDHC were identified as hub genes in the PPI network. Of these, HDAC5, DDX17, and ILF3 were found to be closely related to the overall survival of GC patients. DisNor identified the first neighbors of the key genes. Furthermore, CMap profiles predicted a group of small molecules, including several histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), menadione, and mibefradil, which could serve as promising therapeutic agents to reverse acquired resistance to CF therapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings reveal new targets and alternative therapies to overcome the acquired resistance of GC patients to CF treatment.	2021	Identification of gene signatures and potential therapeutic targets for acquired chemotherapy resistance in gastric cancer patients.	34012635	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC7936959	10.1007/s00221-020-05992-8	We applied high-density EEG to examine steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) during a perceptual/semantic stimulus repetition design. SSVEPs are evoked oscillatory cortical responses at the same frequency as visual stimuli flickered at this frequency. In repetition designs, stimuli are presented twice with the repetition being task irrelevant. The cortical processing of the second stimulus is commonly characterized by decreased neuronal activity (repetition suppression). The behavioral consequences of stimulus repetition were examined in a companion reaction time pre-study using the same experimental design as the EEG study. During the first presentation of a stimulus, we confronted participants with drawings of familiar object images or object words, respectively. The second stimulus was either a repetition of the same object image (perceptual repetition; PR) or an image depicting the word presented during the first presentation (semantic repetition; SR)-all flickered at 15 Hz to elicit SSVEPs. The behavioral study revealed priming effects in both experimental conditions (PR and SR). In the EEG, PR was associated with repetition suppression of SSVEP amplitudes at left occipital and repetition enhancement at left temporal electrodes. In contrast, SR was associated with SSVEP suppression at left occipital and central electrodes originating in bilateral postcentral and occipital gyri, right middle frontal and right temporal gyrus. The conclusion of the presented study is twofold. First, SSVEP amplitudes do not only index perceptual aspects of incoming sensory information but also semantic aspects of cortical object representation. Second, our electrophysiological findings can be interpreted as neuronal underpinnings of perceptual and semantic priming.	2021	The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) reflects the activation of cortical object representations: evidence from semantic stimulus repetition.	33315126	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

However, the molecular mechanisms and prognostic value of GINS2 in breast cancer remain unknown. The present study used; BC-GenExMiner, COSMIC, UCSC Xena, The Human Protein Atlas, GEPIA, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, TIMER and Oncomine, in order to investigate gene expression, co-expression, clinical parameters and mutations in GINS2 in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, the present study assessed the prognostic value of GINS2 in patients with breast cancer via the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. The results of the present study demonstrated that the mRNA levels of GINS2 were significantly higher in breast cancer tissue compared with normal tissue. In addition, high mRNA expression levels of GINS2 were associated with high Scarff-Bloom-Richardson status grades, a basal-like status and age (≤51 years); however, it was not associated with lymph node metastasis. The survival analysis revealed that increased GINS2 mRNA levels were associated with a worse prognosis for relapse-free survival in all patients with breast cancer, particularly in those with estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive subtypes. In addition, a positive association between the GINS2, CENPM and MCM4 genes was confirmed.

PMC8368024	10.1038/s41598-021-96095-z	RNA analysis of post-mortem tissues, or thanatotranscriptomics, has become a topic of interest in forensic science due to the essential information it can provide in forensic investigations. Several studies have previously investigated the effect of death on gene transcription, but it has never been conducted with samples of the same individual. For the first time, a longitudinal mRNA expression analysis study was performed with post-mortem human blood samples from individuals with a known time of death. The results reveal that, after death, two clearly differentiated groups of up- and down-regulated genes can be detected. Pathway analysis suggests active processes that promote cell survival and DNA damage repair, rather than passive degradation, are the source of early post-mortem changes of gene expression in blood. In addition, a generalized linear model with an elastic net restriction predicted post-mortem interval with a root mean square error of 4.75 h. In conclusion, we demonstrate that post-mortem gene expression data can be used as biomarkers to estimate the post-mortem interval though further validation using independent sample sets is required before use in forensic casework.	2021	Cell survival and DNA damage repair are promoted in the human blood thanatotranscriptome shortly after death.	34400689	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC4063357	NA	<h4>Purpose</h4>Mutations in genes encoding proteins from the tri-snRNP complex of the spliceosome account for more than 12% of cases of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). Although the exact mechanism by which splicing factor defects trigger photoreceptor death is not completely clear, their role in retinitis pigmentosa has been demonstrated by several genetic and functional studies. To test for possible novel associations between splicing factors and adRP, we screened four tri-snRNP splicing factor genes (EFTUD2, PRPF4, NHP2L1, and AAR2) as candidate disease genes.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened up to 303 patients with adRP from Europe and North America who did not carry known RP mutations. Exon-PCR and Sanger methods were used to sequence the NHP2L1 and AAR2 genes, while the sequences of EFTUD2 and PRPF4 were obtained by using long-range PCRs spanning coding and non-coding regions followed by next-generation sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>We detected novel missense changes in individual patients in the sequence of the genes PRPF4 and EFTUD2, but the role of these changes in relationship to disease could not be verified. In one other patient we identified a novel nucleotide substitution in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of NHP2L1, which did not segregate with the disease in the family.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The absence of clearly pathogenic mutations in the candidate genes screened in our cohort suggests that EFTUD2, PRPF4, NHP2L1, and AAR2 are either not involved in adRP or are associated with the disease in rare instances, at least as observed in this study in patients of European and North American origin.	2014	Mutational screening of splicing factor genes in cases with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.	24959063	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC3672837	10.1038/nature11843	The active centre of the spliceosome consists of an intricate network formed by U5, U2 and U6 small nuclear RNAs, and a pre-messenger-RNA substrate. Prp8, a component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle, crosslinks extensively with this RNA catalytic core. Here we present the crystal structure of yeast Prp8 (residues 885-2413) in complex with Aar2, a U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle assembly factor. The structure reveals tightly associated domains of Prp8 resembling a bacterial group II intron reverse transcriptase and a type II restriction endonuclease. Suppressors of splice-site mutations, and an intron branch-point crosslink, map to a large cavity formed by the reverse transcriptase thumb, and the endonuclease-like and RNaseH-like domains. This cavity is large enough to accommodate the catalytic core of group II intron RNA. The structure provides crucial insights into the architecture of the spliceosome active site, and reinforces the notion that nuclear pre-mRNA splicing and group II intron splicing have a common origin.	2013	Crystal structure of Prp8 reveals active site cavity of the spliceosome.	23354046	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

Here, we present the structure of yeast Brr2 in complex with the Jab1/MPN domain of Prp8, which stimulates Brr2 activity. Contrary to previous reports, our crystal structure and mutagenesis data show that the Jab1/MPN domain binds exclusively to the N-terminal helicase cassette. The residues in the Jab1/MPN domain, whose mutations in human Prp8 cause the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa, are found at or near the interface with Brr2, clarifying its molecular pathology. In the cytoplasm, Prp8 forms a precursor complex with U5 snRNA, seven Smproteins, Snu114, and Aar2, but after nuclear import, Brr2 replaces Aar2 to form mature U5 snRNP. Our structure explains why Aar2 and Brr2 are mutually exclusive and provides important insights into the assembly of U5 snRNP.	2013	Structural basis of Brr2-Prp8 interactions and implications for U5 snRNP biogenesis and the spliceosome active site.	23727230	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC9744541	10.1002/ggn2.10024	Strong selection has resulted in substantial morphological and behavioral diversity across modern dog breeds, which makes dogs interesting model animals to study the underlying genetic architecture of these traits. However, results from between-breed analyses may confound selection signatures for behavior and morphological features that were coselected during breed development. In this study, we assess population genetic differences in a unique resource of dogs of the same breed but with systematic behavioral selection in only one population. We exploit these different breeding backgrounds to identify signatures of recent selection. Selection signatures within populations were found on chromosomes 4 and 19, with the strongest signals in behavior-related genes. Regions showing strong signals of divergent selection were located on chromosomes 1, 24, and 32, and include candidate genes for both physical features and behavior. Some of the selection signatures appear to be driven by loci associated with coat color (Chr 24; <i>ASIP</i>) and length (Chr 32; <i>FGF5</i>), while others showed evidence of association with behavior. Our findings suggest that signatures of selection within dog breeds have been driven by selection for morphology and behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining selection scans with association analyses is effective for dissecting the traits under selection.	2020	Unravelling selection signatures in a single dog breed suggests recent selection for morphological and behavioral traits.	36619250	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC6544706	10.1007/s11357-019-00071-5	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and non-genetic factors. Hypertension is one of the AD risk factors that has been linked to underlying pathological changes like senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation as well as hippocampal atrophy. In this study, we investigated the differences in the genetic architecture of AD between hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects in four independent cohorts. Our genome-wide association analyses revealed significant associations of 15 novel potentially AD-associated polymorphisms (P < 5E-06) that were located outside the chromosome 19q13 region and were significant either in hypertensive or non-hypertensive groups. The closest genes to 14 polymorphisms were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Also, four of them were located within two chromosomal regions (i.e., 3q13.11 and 17q21.2) that were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 before. In addition, 30 genes demonstrated evidence of group-specific associations with AD at the false discovery rates (FDR) < 0.05 in our gene-based and transcriptome-wide association analyses. The chromosomal regions corresponding to four genes (i.e., 2p13.1, 9p13.3, 17q12, and 18q21.1) were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 in previous GWAS. These genes may serve as a list of prioritized candidates for future functional studies. Our pathway-enrichment analyses revealed the associations of 11 non-group-specific and four group-specific pathways with AD at FDR < 0.05. These findings provided novel insights into the potential genetic heterogeneity of AD among subjects with and without hypertension.	2019	Genetic heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with and without hypertension.	31055733	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

PMC7286871	10.1007/s00221-020-05819-6	Gist perception refers to perceiving the substance or general meaning of a scene. To investigate its neuronal mechanisms, we used the steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) method-an evoked oscillatory cortical response at the same frequency as a visual stimulus flickered at this frequency. Two neighboring stimuli were flickered at different frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub>, for example, a drawing of a sun on the left side of the screen flickering at 8.6 Hz and the drawing of a parasol on the right side of the screen flickering at 12 Hz. SSVEPs enabled us to separate the responses to the two distinct stimuli by extracting oscillatory brain responses at f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, it allowed to investigate intermodulation frequencies, that is, the brain's response at a linear combination of f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> (here at f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub> = 20.6 Hz) as an indicator of processing shared aspects of the input, that is, gist perception (here: a beach scene). We recorded high-density EEG of 18 participants. Results revealed clear and separable neuronal oscillations at f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, occipital electrodes showed increased amplitudes at the intermodulation frequency in related as compared to unrelated pairs. The increase in intermodulation frequency was associated with bilateral temporal and parietal lobe activation, probably reflecting the interaction of local object representations as a basis for activating the gist network. The study demonstrates that SSVEPs are an excellent method to unravel mechanisms underlying the processing within multi-stimulus displays in the context of gist perception.	2020	Electrophysiological correlates of gist perception: a steady-state visually evoked potentials study.	32363553	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC7897482	10.1093/nar/gkaa1274	Pre-mRNA splicing catalyzed by the spliceosome represents a critical step in the regulation of gene expression contributing to transcriptome and proteome diversity. The spliceosome consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), the biogenesis of which remains only partially understood. Here we define the evolutionarily conserved protein Ecdysoneless (Ecd) as a critical regulator of U5 snRNP assembly and Prp8 stability. Combining Drosophila genetics with proteomic approaches, we demonstrate the Ecd requirement for the maintenance of adult healthspan and lifespan and identify the Sm ring protein SmD3 as a novel interaction partner of Ecd. We show that the predominant task of Ecd is to deliver Prp8 to the emerging U5 snRNPs in the cytoplasm. Ecd deficiency, on the other hand, leads to reduced Prp8 protein levels and compromised U5 snRNP biogenesis, causing loss of splicing fidelity and transcriptome integrity. Based on our findings, we propose that Ecd chaperones Prp8 to the forming U5 snRNP allowing completion of the cytoplasmic part of the U5 snRNP biogenesis pathway necessary to meet the cellular demand for functional spliceosomes.	2021	Ecd promotes U5 snRNP maturation and Prp8 stability.	33444449	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC3983036	10.1371/journal.pgen.1004287	The steroid hormone ecdysone coordinates insect growth and development, directing the major postembryonic transition of forms, metamorphosis. The steroid-deficient ecdysoneless1 (ecd1) strain of Drosophila melanogaster has long served to assess the impact of ecdysone on gene regulation, morphogenesis, or reproduction. However, ecd also exerts cell-autonomous effects independently of the hormone, and mammalian Ecd homologs have been implicated in cell cycle regulation and cancer. Why the Drosophila ecd1 mutants lack ecdysone has not been resolved. Here, we show that in Drosophila cells, Ecd directly interacts with core components of the U5 snRNP spliceosomal complex, including the conserved Prp8 protein. In accord with a function in pre-mRNA splicing, Ecd and Prp8 are cell-autonomously required for survival of proliferating cells within the larval imaginal discs. In the steroidogenic prothoracic gland, loss of Ecd or Prp8 prevents splicing of a large intron from CYP307A2/spookier (spok) pre-mRNA, thus eliminating this essential ecdysone-biosynthetic enzyme and blocking the entry to metamorphosis. Human Ecd (hEcd) can substitute for its missing fly ortholog. When expressed in the Ecd-deficient prothoracic gland, hEcd re-establishes spok pre-mRNA splicing and protein expression, restoring ecdysone synthesis and normal development. Our work identifies Ecd as a novel pre-mRNA splicing factor whose function has been conserved in its human counterpart. Whether the role of mammalian Ecd in cancer involves pre-mRNA splicing remains to be discovered.	2014	Unexpected role of the steroid-deficiency protein ecdysoneless in pre-mRNA splicing.	24722212	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC3182018	10.1101/gad.635911	Little is known about how particle-specific proteins are assembled on spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Brr2p is a U5 snRNP-specific RNA helicase required for spliceosome catalytic activation and disassembly. In yeast, the Aar2 protein is part of a cytoplasmic precursor U5 snRNP that lacks Brr2p and is replaced by Brr2p in the nucleus. Here we show that Aar2p and Brr2p bind to different domains in the C-terminal region of Prp8p; Aar2p interacts with the RNaseH domain, whereas Brr2p interacts with the Jab1/MPN domain. These domains are connected by a long, flexible linker, but the Aar2p-RNaseH complex sequesters the Jab1/MPN domain, thereby preventing binding by Brr2p. Aar2p is phosphorylated in vivo, and a phospho-mimetic S253E mutation in Aar2p leads to disruption of the Aar2p-Prp8p complex in favor of the Brr2p-Prp8p complex. We propose a model in which Aar2p acts as a phosphorylation-controlled U5 snRNP assembly factor that regulates the incorporation of the particle-specific Brr2p. The purpose of this regulation may be to safeguard against nonspecific RNA binding to Prp8p and/or premature activation of Brr2p activity.	2011	Mechanism for Aar2p function as a U5 snRNP assembly factor.	21764848	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

In order to assess genetic variation and signatures of selection within a Nilo-Saharan population and between the Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo and Afro-Asiatic, we sequenced 50 genomes from the Nilo-Saharan Lugbara population of North-West Uganda and 250 genomes from 6 previously unsequenced Niger-Congo populations. We compared these data to data from a further 16 Eurasian and African populations including the Gumuz, another putative Nilo-Saharan population from Ethiopia. Of the 21 million variants identified in the Nilo-Saharan population, 3.57 million (17%) were not represented in dbSNP and included predicted non-synonymous mutations with possible phenotypic effects. We found greater genetic differentiation between the Nilo-Saharan Lugbara and Gumuz populations than between any two Afro-Asiatic or Niger-Congo populations. F3 tests showed that Gumuz contributed a genetic component to most Niger-Congo B populations whereas Lugabara did not. We scanned the genomes of the Lugbara for evidence of selective sweeps. We found selective sweeps at four loci (SLC24A5, SNX13, TYRP1, and UVRAG) associated with skin pigmentation, three of which already have been reported to be under selection. These selective sweeps point toward adaptations to the intense UV radiation of the Sahel.	2020	High Levels of Genetic Diversity within Nilo-Saharan Populations: Implications for Human Adaptation.	32781046	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

Dysregulation of this intricate molecular architecture leads to severe human diseases, commonly referred to as ciliopathies. However, the molecular underpinnings how ciliary signaling orchestrates a specific cellular output remain elusive. By combining spatially resolved optogenetics with RNA sequencing and imaging, we reveal a novel cAMP signalosome that is functionally distinct from the cytoplasm. We identify the genes and pathways targeted by the ciliary cAMP signalosome and shed light on the underlying mechanisms and downstream signaling. We reveal that chronic stimulation of the ciliary cAMP signalosome transforms kidney epithelia from tubules into cysts. Counteracting this chronic cAMP elevation in the cilium by small molecules targeting activation of phosphodiesterase-4 long isoforms inhibits cyst growth. Thereby, we identify a novel concept of how the primary cilium controls cellular functions and maintains tissue integrity in a specific and spatially distinct manner and reveal novel molecular components that might be involved in the development of one of the most common genetic diseases, polycystic kidney disease.	2022	A cAMP signalosome in primary cilia drives gene expression and kidney cyst formation.	35695071	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

The contribution of AS to stress is known in many species related to stress, but the posttranscriptional mechanism in poplar under cold stress is still unclear. Recent studies have utilized the advantages of single molecular real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology from Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) to identify full-length transcripts. We, therefore, used a combination of single-molecule long-read sequencing and Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) for a global analysis of AS in two poplar species (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> and <i>P. ussuriensis</i>) under cold stress. We further identified 1,261 AS events in <i>P. trichocarpa</i> and 2,101 in <i>P. ussuriensis</i> among which intron retention, with a frequency of more than 30%, was the most prominent type under cold stress. RNA-Seq data analysis and annotation revealed the importance of calcium, abscisic acid, and reactive oxygen species signaling in cold stress response. Besides, the low temperature rapidly induced multiple splicing factors, transcription factors, and differentially expressed genes through AS. In <i>P. ussuriensis</i>, there was a rapid occurrence of AS events, which provided a new insight into the complexity and regulation of AS during cold stress response in different poplar species for the first time.	2021	PacBio and Illumina RNA Sequencing Identify Alternative Splicing Events in Response to Cold Stress in Two Poplar Species.	34691113	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

Isolates predominantly harbored more than one plasmid replicon and some harbored plasmid replicons on the same contigs as the ESBL genes.

A high heterogeneity was found among the ESBL-producing E. coli from pigs and workers, with most isolates belonging to unrelated phylogroups, serogroups, and sequence types with >4046 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms-(SNPs). In comparing the genomes of pig isolates to those from humans, it appeared that ESBL-producing E. coli in workers did not predominantly originate from pigs but were rather host-specific. Nevertheless, the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli carrying plasmid-mediated colistin and quinolone resistance genes in pigs could represent a potential source for horizontal transmission to humans through food rather than direct contact.	2021	Genetic Comparison of ESBL-Producing Escherichia coli from Workers and Pigs at Vietnamese Pig Farms. 	34680746	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms between proximal and distal CRC and to identify the responsible genes, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of colorectal tumors from two microarray datasets, GSE39582 and GSE14333, on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and the RNA‑seq data from TCGA. Weighted coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to construct a gene coexpression network. The red module in GSE39582 and the dark‑gray module from the TCGA dataset were found to be highly correlated with the anatomical site of CRC. A total of 12 hub genes were found in two datasets, 2 of which PLAG1 like zinc finger 2 (PLAGL2) and protein O‑fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) were common and upregulated in tumor samples in CRC. The module with the highest correlation provided references that will help to characterize the difference between left‑sided and right‑sided CRC. The survival analysis of PLAGL2 and POFUT1 expression revealed differences between proximal and distal CRC. Gene set enrichment analysis based on those two genes provided similar results: GPI anchor biosynthesis and peroxisome and selenoamino acid metabolism. PLAGL2 and POFUT1, which have the highest correlation with tumor location, may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the precise diagnosis and treatment of CRC in the future.	2019	Weighted gene coexpression analysis indicates that PLAGL2 and POFUT1 are related to the differential features of proximal and distal colorectal cancer.	31638246	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

Eighteen visually normal, young-adult subjects (ages 21-28 years) were tested binocularly at 1 m for each condition on two separate days. The Diopsys™ NOVA-TR system was used to obtain the visual-evoked potential (VEP) and extracted alpha wave and its related power spectrum. Additionally, the Visual Search and Attention Test (VSAT) was administered as a subjective measure of visual attention.<h4>Results</h4>Subjects exhibited significant decreases in power in the alpha band when comparing the eyes-closed with the eyes-open conditions, with power in the eyes-closed condition being, on average, twice as large. The response from the other four conditions did not reflect the differential attentional demands. The ratio of the power in the eyes-closed condition to the eyes-open condition in the lower-alpha frequencies (8-10 Hz) was found to be significantly correlated with the group's performance on the VSAT, especially the 10-Hz component.<h4>Conclusions</h4>An individual's ability to attenuate their alpha component during visual processing may be a predictor of their visual attentional state. These findings solidify the role of the VEP alpha subcomponent as an objective electrophysiological correlate of visual attention, which may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of human visual attention disorders in the future.	2013	Objective assessment of the human visual attentional state.	23111658	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

NA	10.21203/rs.3.rs-28592/v1	World over, people are looking for solutions to tackle the pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2/nCoV-19. Notable contributions in biomedical field have been characterizing viral genomes, host transcriptomes and proteomes, repurposable drugs and vaccines. In one such study, 332 human proteins targeted by nCoV19 were identified. We expanded this set of host proteins by constructing their protein interactome, including in it not only the known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) but also novel, hitherto unknown PPIs predicted with our High-precision Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) model that was shown to be highly accurate. In fact, one of the earliest discoveries made possible by HiPPIP is related to activation of immunity upon viral infection. We found that several interactors of the host proteins are differentially expressed upon viral infection, are related to highly relevant pathways, and that the novel interaction of NUP98 with CHMP5 may activate an antiviral mechanism leading to disruption of viral budding. We are making the interactions available as downloadable files to facilitate future systems biology studies and also on a web-server at http://hagrid.dbmi.pitt.edu/corona that allows not only keyword search but also queries such as “PPIs where one protein is associated with ‘virus’ and the interactors with 'pulmonary'”.	2020	Interactome of SARS-CoV-2 / nCoV19 modulated host proteins with computationally predicted PPIs	NA	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol

Compared to other structural methods, crystallography has its own advantage in the high-resolution structural information it can provide and the unique biological questions it can answer. In addition, two new crystallographic methods - the serial femtosecond crystallography and 3D electron crystallography - were developed to overcome some of the limitations of traditional X-ray crystallography and broaden the range of biological problems that crystallography can solve. This review discusses the theoretical basis, instrument requirements, troubleshooting, and exciting potential of these crystallographic methods to further our understanding of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical event in gene expression of all eukaryotes.	2017	Understanding pre-mRNA splicing through crystallography.	28506657	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC3690710	10.1002/pro.2266	Pre-mRNA splicing is a critical event in the gene expression pathway of all eukaryotes. The splicing reaction is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a huge protein-RNA complex that contains five snRNAs and hundreds of different protein factors. Understanding the structure of this large molecular machinery is critical for understanding its function. Although the highly dynamic nature of the spliceosome, in both composition and conformation, posed daunting challenges to structural studies, there has been significant recent progress on structural analyses of the splicing machinery, using electron microscopy, crystallography, and nuclear magnetic resonance. This review discusses key recent findings in the structural analyses of the spliceosome and its components and how these findings advance our understanding of the function of the splicing machinery.	2013	Structural analyses of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery.	23592432	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC4889648	10.1534/g3.116.027508	Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential component of eukaryotic gene expression and is highly conserved from unicellular yeasts to humans. Here, we present the development and implementation of a sequencing-based reverse genetic screen designed to identify nonessential genes that impact pre-mRNA splicing in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an organism that shares many of the complex features of splicing in higher eukaryotes. Using a custom-designed barcoding scheme, we simultaneously queried ∼3000 mutant strains for their impact on the splicing efficiency of two endogenous pre-mRNAs. A total of 61 nonessential genes were identified whose deletions resulted in defects in pre-mRNA splicing; enriched among these were factors encoding known or predicted components of the spliceosome. Included among the candidates identified here are genes with well-characterized roles in other RNA-processing pathways, including heterochromatic silencing and 3' end processing. Splicing-sensitive microarrays confirm broad splicing defects for many of these factors, revealing novel functional connections between these pathways.	2016	Interconnections Between RNA-Processing Pathways Revealed by a Sequencing-Based Genetic Screen for Pre-mRNA Splicing Mutants in Fission Yeast.	27172183	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
PMC5934631	10.1093/nar/gky242	Precursor message RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is executed by the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) machinery that is comparable to the ribosome. Driven by the rapid progress of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) technology, high resolution structures of the spliceosome in its different splicing stages have proliferated over the past three years, which has greatly facilitated the mechanistic understanding of pre-mRNA splicing. As the largest and most conserved protein in the spliceosome, Prp8 plays a pivotal role within this protein-directed ribozyme. Structure determination of different spliceosomal complexes has revealed intimate and dynamic interactions between Prp8 and catalytic RNAs as well as with other protein factors during splicing. Here we review the structural dynamics of two elements of Prp8, the N-terminal domain (N-domain) and the Switch loop, and delineate the dynamic organisation and underlying functional significance of these two elements during spliceosome assembly and activation. Further biochemical and structural dissections of idiographic splicing stages are much needed for a complete understanding of the spliceosome and pre-mRNA splicing.	2018	Structural dynamics of the N-terminal domain and the Switch loop of Prp8 during spliceosome assembly and activation.	29635373	AAR2	C20orf4	primary_symbol
NA	NA	Subcritical water extraction (SWE) is a process for extracting valuable compounds of catechin and epicatechin from the skin of the peanut (Arachis hypogea). The research's objective was to identify the best extraction conditions for recovering total catechin compounds (TCC), total epicatechin compounds (TEC), and total yield from peanut skin. The solubility of yield in subcritical water was determined using the Chrastil and Del Valle Aguilera models. The best conditions were 13.56 MPa, 11.66 ml/min, 160°C with responses of TCC 10.81 mg/g, TEC 8.41 mg/g, and yield 0.268 g/g. High pressure and temperature conditions were conducive to TEC recovery, whereas high flow rate conditions were suitable to TEC and total yield enhancement. The Chrastil model fits the solubility of yield in subcritical water effectively since it has the lower average absolute relative deviation, which is 85.507% compared to Del Valle Aguilera of 85.509%. The Chrastil and Del Valle Aguilera model was not suitable for the solubility of peanut skin extract due to high percentage of AARD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The catechin and epicatechin from peanut skin were frequently recovered using a hazardous solvent in a traditional extraction procedure. Subcritical water extraction is one of the methods for overcoming the toxicity of solvents. The best condition for obtaining maximum total catechin compounds (TCC), total epicatechin compounds (TEC) was determined using response surface methodology. Furthermore, in this work, a semi‐empirical model was utilized to evaluate the effect of parameters to improve the solubility of bioactive compounds. TEC recovery was enhanced by high pressure and temperature, while TEC and total yield augmentation were enhanced by high flow rate.	2023	Solubilization and extraction of valuable compounds from peanut skin in subcritical water	NA	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
NA	10.1111/1756-185x.14789	<h4>Aim</h4>To investigate the relationship between the prevalence of antinuclear antibody (ANA) -associated rheumatic diseases (AARD) and the presence of dense fine speckled (DFS) and homogeneous patterns in ANA tests.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study enrolled adult patients with either a DFS or homogeneous pattern in their ANA test. A mixed pattern was defined as the presence of more than one pattern reported in the test. The presence of anti-DFS70 antibodies and other common autoantibodies were detected using EUROLINE ANA Profile 23. A 1:2 propensity score matching was applied to control for demographic and other interfering factors.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 59 patients with a DFS pattern were enrolled and compared with a matched homogeneous group. The DFS group had a significantly lower prevalence of AARD (3.4% vs. 16.9%, p = .008) and the subgroup with anti-DFS70 antibodies showed an even lower prevalence (2% vs. 20%, p = .002). Among the 33 patients with monospecific anti-DFS70 antibodies, five had a mixed pattern, and all patients with common autoantibodies had an isolated DFS pattern.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings of this study suggest that patients with a DFS pattern in their ANA test may have a lower prevalence of AARD compared with those with a homogeneous pattern. However, an isolated DFS pattern in ANA testing does not necessarily indicate the presence of monospecific anti-DFS70 antibodies or AARD. Confirmatory testing for the monospecific anti-DFS70 antibody is mandatory to exclude AARD.	2023	The significance of dense fine speckled pattern in antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic disease and coexisting autoantibodies: A propensity score-matched cohort study.	37338084	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
NA	10.1007/s10840-023-01497-w	<h4>Background</h4>The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) is an important tool in mitigating sudden cardiac death (SCD). The WCD provides patient alarms for detected arrhythmias or electrical noise/artifact. Some patients experience frequent alarms for artifact. We sought to evaluate the effects of a novel artificial intelligence algorithm to reduce alarms related to electrical noise or artifact (advanced arrhythmia discrimination algorithm, AArD).<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective review of a large commercial database of prescribed WCD. Patients prescribed the WCD during the years 2017 (discrimination algorithm, DA group) or during 2019 (advanced arrhythmia discrimination algorithm, AArD) were analyzed. A total of 96,000 patients were sampled, 48,000 in the control group (using standard direct algorithm, DA) and compared to 48,000 in the intervention AArD (4000 per group per month) for 12 months. The AArD further discriminates ECG signals based on a machine-learning algorithm utilizing intensity and frequency beyond the standard DA. Outcomes regarding alarms, arrhythmias, and safety were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>The AArD algorithm was associated with a significant decrease in frequency of alarms over the course of WCD use; 54% of patients in the AARD versus 27% of DA had 0 alarms (P < .001). In the entire cohort, there was a 56% relative reduction in alarms with the use of AArD. Appropriate arrhythmia treatment time was not significantly different between the groups (44 s DA vs 45 s AArD [p = ns]).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel artificial intelligence algorithm reduces alarms without delaying appropriate therapy for VT/VF. These changes may improve compliance and quality of life in patients with a WCD.	2023	A novel artificial intelligence based algorithm to reduce wearable cardioverter-defibrillator alarms.	36790576	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC10138630	10.3390/ijms24087316	Molecular dynamics simulations employing the all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulations (OPLS-AA) force field were performed for determining self-diffusion coefficients (D11) of ethanol and tracer diffusion coefficients (D12) of solutes in ethanol at several temperature and pressure conditions. For simulations employing the original OPLS-AA diameter of ethanol's oxygen atom (σOH), calculated and experimental diffusivities of protic solutes differed by more than 25%. To correct this behavior, the σOH was reoptimized using the experimental D12 of quercetin and of gallic acid in liquid ethanol as benchmarks. A substantial improvement of the calculated diffusivities was found by changing σOH from its original value (0.312 nm) to 0.306 nm, with average absolute relative deviations (AARD) of 3.71% and 4.59% for quercetin and gallic acid, respectively. The new σOH value was further tested by computing D12 of ibuprofen and butan-1-ol in liquid ethanol with AARDs of 1.55% and 4.81%, respectively. A significant improvement was also obtained for the D11 of ethanol with AARD = 3.51%. It was also demonstrated that in the case of diffusion coefficients of non-polar solutes in ethanol, the original σOH=0.312 nm should be used for better agreement with experiment. If equilibrium properties such as enthalpy of vaporization and density are estimated, the original diameter should be once again adopted.	2023	Influence of Ethanol Parametrization on Diffusion Coefficients Using OPLS-AA Force Field.	37108479	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC10232494	10.1038/s41598-023-36071-x	Membranes are a potential technology to reduce energy consumption as well as environmental challenges considering the separation processes. A new class of this technology, namely mixed matrix membrane (MMM) can be fabricated by dispersing solid substances in a polymeric medium. In this way, the poly(4-methyl-1-pentene)-based MMMs have attracted great attention to capturing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), which is an environmental pollutant with a greenhouse effect. The CO<sub>2</sub> permeability in different MMMs constituted of poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) (PMP) and nanoparticles was comprehensively analyzed from the experimental point of view. In addition, a straightforward mathematical model is necessary to compute the CO<sub>2</sub> permeability before constructing the related PMP-based separation process. Hence, the current study employs multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks (MLP-ANN) to relate the CO<sub>2</sub> permeability in PMP/nanoparticle MMMs to the membrane composition (additive type and dose) and pressure. Accordingly, the effect of these independent variables on CO<sub>2</sub> permeability in PMP-based membranes is explored using multiple linear regression analysis. It was figured out that the CO<sub>2</sub> permeability has a direct relationship with all independent variables, while the nanoparticle dose is the strongest one. The MLP-ANN structural features have efficiently demonstrated an appealing potential to achieve the highest accurate prediction for CO<sub>2</sub> permeability. A two-layer MLP-ANN with the 3-8-1 topology trained by the Bayesian regulation algorithm is identified as the best model for the considered problem. This model simulates 112 experimentally measured CO<sub>2</sub> permeability in PMP/ZnO, PMP/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, PMP/TiO<sub>2</sub>, and PMP/TiO<sub>2</sub>-NT with an excellent absolute average relative deviation (AARD) of lower than 5.5%, mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.87 and correlation coefficient (R) of higher than 0.99470. It was found that the mixed matrix membrane constituted of PMP and TiO<sub>2</sub>-NT (functionalized nanotube with titanium dioxide) is the best medium for CO<sub>2</sub> separation.	2023	Modeling the CO<sub>2</sub> separation capability of poly(4-methyl-1-pentane) membrane modified with different nanoparticles by artificial neural networks.	37258709	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

Here the authors describe the very rare association between inflammatory bowel disease and AARD in a child.<h4>Observations</h4>A 7-year-old girl presented with an 11-month history of torticollis that occurred spontaneously without a trauma context. Her history revealed a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Physical exam of the cervical spine revealed a ""cock-robin"" posture. Neck radiography and three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction established the diagnosis of AARD. Given the duration of the symptoms and failure of previous conservative treatments, the patient was taken to the operating room and underwent open reduction through posterior approach with a C1-2 fusion according to the Harms technique. The torticollis resolved with no recurrence at the last follow-up and minimal restriction of rotation.<h4>Lessons</h4>This is the third report to describe the very rare association between inflammatory bowel disease and AARD but at a very early age, the youngest in the literature.

NA	10.1590/1519-6984.270865	The present study aimed to evaluate concentrations and forms of application of salicylic acid used for water stress mitigation on the gas exchange and growth of yellow passion fruit. The experimental design was arranged in randomized blocks in a 4 × 4 × 2 factorial scheme, with four concentrations of salicylic acid (SA) via foliar application (0.0, 0.7, 1.4, and 2.1 mM), four SA concentrations via fertigation (0.0, 0.7, 1.4, and 2.1 mM), and two irrigation depths estimated based on the actual evapotranspiration - ETr (50 and 100% of ETr), with three replications. Water stress negatively affected the physiology and growth of yellow passion fruit seedlings at 75 days after sowing (DAS). The application of salicylic acid, regardless of the form of application, attenuates the effects of water stress on gas exchange and growth of yellow passion fruit, with the best results obtained when applying a concentration of 1.30 mM via leaf or 0.90 mM via fertirrigation. The combination of foliar application of AS and fertigation contributed to improve photosynthetic and growth parameters under water conditions of 50 and 100% of ETr. The foliar application of AS presents superior responses to the application via fertigation. These results reinforce the hypothesis that the attenuation of water stress by salicylic acid is related to the maintenance of gas exchange, which depends on the concentration and form of application, and studies testing combinations throughout the crop cycle become promising for advances in knowledge from the action of this phytohormone on abiotic stress.	2023	Salicylic acid concentrations and forms of application mitigate water stress in sour passion fruit seedlings.	37222368	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC10049303	10.3390/ijerph20065059	Some natural gases are toxic because they contain hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). The solubility pattern of elemental sulfur (S) in toxic natural gas needs to be studied for environmental protection and life safety. Some methods (e.g., experiments) may pose safety risks. Measuring sulfur solubility using a machine learning (ML) method is fast and accurate. Considering the limited experimental data on sulfur solubility, this study used consensus nested cross-validation (cnCV) to obtain more information. The global search capability and learning efficiency of random forest (RF) and weighted least squares support vector machine (WLSSVM) models were enhanced via a whale optimization-genetic algorithm (WOA-GA). Hence, the WOA-GA-RF and WOA-GA-WLSSVM models were developed to accurately predict the solubility of sulfur and reveal its variation pattern. WOA-GA-RF outperformed six other similar models (e.g., RF model) and six other published studies (e.g., the model designed by Roberts et al.). Using the generic positional oligomer importance matrix (gPOIM), this study visualized the contribution of variables affecting sulfur solubility. The results show that temperature, pressure, and H<sub>2</sub>S content all have positive effects on sulfur solubility. Sulfur solubility significantly increases when the H<sub>2</sub>S content exceeds 10%, and other conditions (temperature, pressure) remain the same.	2023	Investigation of the Solubility of Elemental Sulfur (S) in Sulfur-Containing Natural Gas with Machine Learning Methods.	36981966	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
NA	10.20944/preprints202305.1079.v1	In the semi-arid region of Brazil, it is common to use saline or brackish water for crop production. However, this practice can negatively affect the soil, nutrient balance, and fruit quality and production. From this perspective, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of fertilization combinations with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) on the production and quality of West Indian cherry grown under salt stress in the second year of production. The study was conducted in a protected environment following a randomized block design with treatments distributed in a 2 x 10 factorial arrangement referring to two levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECw) (0.6 and 4.0 dS m-1) and 10 NPK fertilization combinations (80-100-100; 100-100-100; 120-100-100; 140-100-100; 100-80-100; 100-120-100; 100-140-100; 100-100-80; 100-100-120 e 100-100-140% of the recommendation in the second year of production), with three replicates and one plant per lysimeter. The results indicate that irrigation of West Indian cherry crop irrigation at the water salinity of 4.0 dS m-1 negatively affected all fruit production variables. The interaction between the ECw of 0.6 dS m-1 and the 100-80-120 NPK fertilization combination increased the total number of fruits and the total fruit weight of West Indian cherry.	2023	Production and Quality of West Indian Cherry under Salt Stress and NPK Fertilization Combinations	NA	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
NA	10.1002/acr.24990	<h4>Objective</h4>Simultaneous antibody testing during screening for autoimmune conditions is discouraged. The incidence of positive extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) in the setting of a negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) has been reported as low. Our objective was to characterize the frequency of diagnosis of new ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD) in the setting of a negative ANA with a positive ENA.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a 7-year retrospective study from a multicenter tertiary health network in Australia. Clinical information was sought on patients over 18 years old who had a negative ANA but positive ENA test result. Results were extracted from hospital computer systems.<h4>Results</h4>From March 19, 2011, to July 23, 2018, ENA testing was ordered simultaneously with an ANA test on 4,248 occasions in 3,484 patients. ANA was positive in 2,520 patients (59.3%) and ENA was positive in 1,980 patients (46.6%). Among positive ANA patients, ENA was positive in 1,563 patients (62.0%). Among 1,728 negative ANA tests, ENA was positive in 417 (24.1%) (P < 0.001). A total of 328 patients with discordant ANA/ENA results had data available for further analysis, of whom 279 had no pre-established rheumatologic condition. A new AARD was diagnosed in 17 of 279 patients, yielding a positive predictive value of 6.09% (95% confidence interval 3.59-9.58).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite the higher-than-expected incidence of positive ENA in the setting of a negative ANA, the yield of newly diagnosed rheumatic diseases was low. Our findings support the stepwise addition of ENA requests when an ANA test result is positive and clinical suspicion of an AARD is high.	2023	Frequency and Clinical Utility of Antibodies to Extractable Nuclear Antigen in the Setting of a Negative Antinuclear Antibody Test.	35904968	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

PMC10223114	10.3390/membranes13050526	Separating carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from gaseous streams released into the atmosphere is becoming critical due to its greenhouse effect. Membrane technology is one of the promising technologies for CO<sub>2</sub> capture. SAPO-34 filler was incorporated in polymeric media to synthesize mixed matrix membrane (MMM) and enhance the CO<sub>2</sub> separation performance of this process. Despite relatively extensive experimental studies, there are limited studies that cover the modeling aspects of CO<sub>2</sub> capture by MMMs. This research applies a special type of machine learning modeling scenario, namely, cascade neural networks (CNN), to simulate as well as compare the CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> selectivity of a wide range of MMMs containing SAPO-34 zeolite. A combination of trial-and-error analysis and statistical accuracy monitoring has been applied to fine-tune the CNN topology. It was found that the CNN with a 4-11-1 topology has the highest accuracy for the modeling of the considered task. The designed CNN model is able to precisely predict the CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> selectivity of seven different MMMs in a broad range of filler concentrations, pressures, and temperatures. The model predicts 118 actual measurements of CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> selectivity with an outstanding accuracy (i.e., AARD = 2.92%, MSE = 1.55, R = 0.9964).	2023	Simulating and Comparing CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> Separation Performance of Membrane-Zeolite Contactors by Cascade Neural Networks.	37233587	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

There are no current guidelines for repeat test ordering. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of repeat ENA testing after an initial negative result.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective study was conducted in a single, multicentre tertiary health network in Melbourne, Australia. Results of all ENA tests were extracted from the hospital laboratory information system. For patients who had a change in ENA result from negative to positive, clinical information was obtained from the hospital records regarding new diagnosis of an ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 23 438 ENA tests were performed in 19 603 patients from 29 July 2013 to 28 September 2020. In total, 20 918 (89.2%) were negative with 215 (0.9%) being equivocal. Of the 2305 positive tests, the most common ENA auto-antibody specificity detected was anti-Ro52 (1185, 51.4%). A total of 2636 of 19 603 patients (13.4%) had more than one ENA test performed during the study period. Of these, most (2523, 95.7%) had stable ENA results with no change compared with the first test. Only 53 patients (2.2%) had an ENA result that changed from negative to positive. Excluding patients with pre-existing rheumatic conditions and those under 18, there were five new AARDs found in the remaining 34 patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Repeat ENA test results rarely change or result in a new diagnosis of an AARD, with repeated testing only warranted if there is a change in clinical manifestations.	2023	Utility of repeat extractable nuclear antigen antibody testing: a retrospective audit.	35916723	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

The objective of this work is to thermodynamically undertake the study of ethylenediamine (EDA)-water, EDA-methanol, EDA-ethanol, and EDA-2-propanol binary mixtures in a manner to be useful for designing separation processes by CPA EoS. Accordingly, CPA EoS was applied to model vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of several practical binary mixtures including EDA-water, EDA-methanol, EDA-ethanol, and EDA-2-propanol. It should be noted that the aforementioned mixtures are being studied by CPA EoS for the first time and necessary details are presented; two different association schemes (different situations for creating hydrogen bonds), 2B and 4C schemes, were considered for EDA. Water and studied alcohols were also modeled by 4C and 2B schemes, respectively. Moreover, the capability of two different combining rules (Elliot and CR-1) was evaluated. The azeotrope point available in the phase diagram of EDA-water system was correctly identified by CPA EoS. Furthermore, the liquid phase density of EDA-water was satisfactorily predicted by CPA EoS. It has also a high level of accuracy in VLE modeling of EDA-methanol, EDA-ethanol, and EDA-2-propanol mixtures. In the end, according to all provided results, it can be said that CPA EoS along with all required parameters obtained in this study is capable of describing thermodynamic behavior of studied mixtures.	2022	Thermodynamic modeling of binary mixtures of ethylenediamine with water, methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol by association theory.	36425680	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9887002	10.1038/s41598-023-28770-2	Oil viscosity plays a prominent role in all areas of petroleum engineering, such as simulating reservoirs, predicting production rate, evaluating oil well performance, and even planning for thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR) that involves fluid flow calculations. Experimental methods of determining oil viscosity, such as the rotational viscometer, are more accurate than other methods. The compositional method can also properly estimate oil viscosity. However, the composition of oil should be determined experimentally, which is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, the occasional inaccessibility of experimental data may make it inevitable to look for convenient methods for fast and accurate prediction of oil viscosity. Hence, in this study, the error in viscosity prediction has been minimized by taking into account the amount of dissolved gas in oil (solution gas-oil ratio: R<sub>s</sub>) as a representative of oil composition along with other conventional black oil features including temperature, pressure, and API gravity by employing recently developed machine learning methods based on the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT): extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), CatBoost, and GradientBoosting. Moreover, the advantage of the proposed method lies in its independence to input viscosity data in each pressure region/stage. The results were then compared with well-known correlations and machine-learning methods employing the black oil approach applying least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and compositional approach implementing decision trees (DTs). XGBoost is offered as the best method with its greater precision and lower error. It provides an overall average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 1.968% which has reduced the error of the compositional method by half and the black oil method (saturated region) by five times. This shows the proper viscosity prediction and corroborates the applied method's performance.	2023	Enhanced intelligent approach for determination of crude oil viscosity at reservoir conditions.	36717732	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

PMC9762917	10.7759/cureus.31678	Traumatic atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation (AARS) is a condition that is extremely rare in adults when compared to the pediatric population. The most common symptoms of this condition are torticollis and post-traumatic neck pain. Our patient is a 41-year-old male who presented to the emergency room within hours of the injury. He came by himself with his relative as a case of road traffic accident. He was the first passenger and had been restrained during the car accident, with no ejection or rollover. He presented with stiffness/pain and reduced range of motion in the neck. Computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine showed rotatory subluxation of C1 over the C2 with a locked facet. Within 24 hours of the RTA and patient admission, we attempted cervical traction. The reduction was not successful. So, we decided to reduce AARS through a surgical approach. The patient was taken to the operating room for open reduction and fixation using the Harms technique for C1-C2 fusion. The patient recovered from the surgery uneventfully, without any complications, recovered cervical mobility, and improved torticollis. Surgical management through open reduction and internal fixation is recommended for AARD cases in which close reduction fails due to a locked facet.	2022	Surgical Treatment of Irreducible AcuteTraumatic Atlantoaxial Rotatory Subluxation in an Adult.	36545162	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC10053306	10.3390/plants12061391	The aim of this work was to investigate the microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) kinetics of polyphenolic compounds from organic peppermint leaves. The phytochemicals of peppermint (<i>Mentha piperita</i> L.) are increasingly used in food technology due to their numerous biological activities. The processing of various plant materials by MAE and the production of high-quality extracts is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, the influence of microwave irradiation power (90, 180, 360, 600, and 800 W) on total extraction yield (Y), total polyphenols yield (TP), and flavonoid yield (TF) were investigated. Common empirical models (first-order, Peleg's hyperbolic, Elovich's logarithmic, and power-law model) were applied to the extraction process. The first-order kinetics model provided the best agreement with the experimental results in terms of statistical parameters (SS<sub>er</sub>, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>, and AARD). Therefore, the influences of irradiation power on the adjustable model parameters (<i>k</i> and <i>C<sub>eq</sub></i>) were investigated. It was found that irradiation power exerted a significant influence on <i>k</i>, while its influence on the asymptotic value of the response was negligible. The highest experimentally determined <i>k</i> (2.28 min<sup>-1</sup>) was obtained at an irradiation power of 600 W, while the optimal irradiation power determined by the maximum fitting curve determination predicted the highest <i>k</i> (2.36 min<sup>-1</sup>) at 665 W.	2023	Kinetics of Microwave-Assisted Extraction Process Applied on Recovery of Peppermint Polyphenols: Experiments and Modeling.	36987079	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9571603	10.3390/molecules27196540	This study correlated biomass heat capacity (Cp) with the chemistry (sulfur and ash content), crystallinity index, and temperature of various samples. A five-parameter linear correlation predicted 576 biomass Cp samples from four different origins with the absolute average relative deviation (AARD%) of ~1.1%. The proportional reduction in error (REE) approved that ash and sulfur contents only enlarge the correlation and have little effect on the accuracy. Furthermore, the REE showed that the temperature effect on biomass heat capacity was stronger than on the crystallinity index. Consequently, a new three-parameter correlation utilizing crystallinity index and temperature was developed. This model was more straightforward than the five-parameter correlation and provided better predictions (AARD = 0.98%). The proposed three-parameter correlation predicted the heat capacity of four different biomass classes with residual errors between -0.02 to 0.02 J/g∙K. The literature related biomass Cp to temperature using quadratic and linear correlations, and ignored the effect of the chemistry of the samples. These quadratic and linear correlations predicted the biomass Cp of the available database with an AARD of 39.19% and 1.29%, respectively. Our proposed model was the first work incorporating sample chemistry in biomass Cp estimation.	2022	Introducing a Linear Empirical Correlation for Predicting the Mass Heat Capacity of Biomaterials.	36235078	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
NA	10.1111/nph.19014	In the absence of light signals, Arabidopsis plants fail to develop the rosette habit typical for this species. Instead, plants display caulescent growth due to elongation of rosette internodes. This aspect of photomorphogenic development has been paid little attention and molecular events involved, downstream of photoreceptor signaling, remain to be identified. Using a combination of genetic and molecular approaches, we show that Arabidopsis rosette habit is a photomorphogenic trait controlled by induction of ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX GENE1 (ATH1) as downstream target of multiple photoreceptors. ATH1 induction prevents rosette internode elongation by maintaining the shoot apical meristem (SAM) rib zone area inactive and requires inactivation of photomorphogenesis inhibitors, including PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF) proteins. ATH1 activity results in tissue-specific inhibition of PIF expression, establishing double-negative feedback-regulation at the SAM. Light-requirement for ATH1 expression can be overcome by high sugar availability to the SAM. Both sugar and light signals that induce ATH1 and, subsequently, rosette habit are mediated by TOR kinase. Collectively, our data reveal a SAM-specific, double-negative ATH1-PIF feedback loop at the basis of rosette habit. Upstream, TOR kinase functions as central hub integrating light and energy signals that control this for Arabidopsis quintessential trait.	2023	Arabidopsis thaliana rosette habit is controlled by combined light and energy signaling converging on transcriptional control of the TALE homeobox gene ATH1.	37291904	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC10054383	10.3390/ijms24065780	The higher heating value (HHV) is the main property showing the energy amount of biomass samples. Several linear correlations based on either the proximate or the ultimate analysis have already been proposed for predicting biomass HHV. Since the HHV relationship with the proximate and ultimate analyses is not linear, nonlinear models might be a better alternative. Accordingly, this study employed the Elman recurrent neural network (ENN) to anticipate the HHV of different biomass samples from both the ultimate and proximate compositional analyses as the model inputs. The number of hidden neurons and the training algorithm were determined in such a way that the ENN model showed the highest prediction and generalization accuracy. The single hidden layer ENN with only four nodes, trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, was identified as the most accurate model. The proposed ENN exhibited reliable prediction and generalization performance for estimating 532 experimental HHVs with a low mean absolute error of 0.67 and a mean square error of 0.96. In addition, the proposed ENN model provides a ground to clearly understand the dependency of the HHV on the fixed carbon, volatile matter, ash, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur content of biomass feedstocks.	2023	A Dynamic Recurrent Neural Network for Predicting Higher Heating Value of Biomass.	36982849	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9502877	10.3390/ma15186416	In this work, a simple two-parameters correlation based on the Rice and Gray, Lennard-Jones, and Stockmayer theories was devised for the calculation of binary diffusion coefficients (D12) of any type of solutes at infinite dilution in polar and non-polar solvents. This equation can be relevant for systems with polar solvents, since most models in the literature fail when strong intermolecular forces predominate in solution. The new correlation embodies the Stockmayer potential without requiring the dipole moments of any component, which significantly enlarges its application. It was validated with the largest D12 database of polar and non-polar dense systems, with 8812 data points (NDP) spanning 553 systems, of which 133 have water as solvent (NDP = 1266), 89 contain polar solvents excluding water (NDP = 1405), 177 have supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) as solvent (NDP = 5028), and 154 have non-polar or weakly polar solvents excluding SC-CO2 (NDP = 1113). Overall, the model achieved an average deviation of only 3.43%, with accurate and unbiased behavior even for polar systems.	2022	Modeling Tracer Diffusion Coefficients of Any Type of Solutes in Polar and Non-Polar Dense Solvents.	36143725	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9905554	10.1038/s41598-023-29228-1	Palbociclib is a poorly water-soluble medicine which acts against metastatic breast cancer cells. Among various techniques to improve the solubility of this medicine, applying supercritical technologies to produce micro- and nano-sized particles is a possible option. For this purpose, extraction of solubility data is required. In this research, the solubility of palbociclib in supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO<sub>2</sub>) at different equilibrium conditions was measured at temperatures between 308 and 338 K and pressures within 12-27 MPa, for the first time. The minimum and maximum solubility data were found to be 8.1 × 10<sup>-7</sup> (at 338 K and 12 MPa) and 2.03 × 10<sup>-5</sup> (at 338 K and 27 MPa), respectively. Thereafter, two sets of models, including ten semi-empirical equations and three Peng-Robinson (PR) based integrated models were used to correlate the experimental solubility data. Bian's model and PR equation of state using van der Waals mixing rules (PR + vdW) showed better accuracy among the examined semi-empirical and integrated models, respectively. Furthermore, the self-consistency of the obtained data was confirmed using two distinct semi-empirical models. At last, the total and vaporization enthalpies of palbociclib solubility in ScCO<sub>2</sub> were calculated from correlation results of semi-empirical equations and estimated to be 40.41 and 52.67 kJ/mol, respectively.	2023	Solubility of palbociclib in supercritical carbon dioxide from experimental measurement and Peng-Robinson equation of state.	36750582	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

PMC9110261	10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e159	<h4>Background</h4>Unnecessary and inappropriate laboratory testing accounts for a significant portion of waste in health care utilization. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic value of the anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test by examining the rate of ANA associated rheumatic disease (AARD) diagnosis among ANA tested and ANA positive subjects and positive predictive value (PPV) of ANA test leading to AARD diagnosis in different ANA titers and different subsets of patients in 5 hospitals affiliated with a university.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively extracted data from all subjects who were tested for ANA from year 2010 to 2019. Those who were first evaluated at or referred to rheumatology were further evaluated with extraction of data including ANA titer and ultimate diagnosis. PPVs for ANA test were evaluated after stratification according to clinically relevant key parameters, such as patient age (younger < 65 years vs. older), sex, and requesting department.<h4>Results</h4>From 2010 to 2019, A total of 94,153 patients were tested for ANA, of which 13,600 (14.4% of the total) were positive. AARD was diagnosed in only 0.69% among all ANA tested patients and 4.74% among ANA positive patients. The AARD diagnosis rate of ANA positive patients varied widely from 0.1% to 8.7% by requesting department. Using cutoff values above 1:320 yielded PPVs of 15.6 and 7.8% for all AARs and systemic lupus erythematosus. The PPV was significantly higher in young age (< 65 years) and in women, and when it was requested from internal medicine vs other departments.<h4>Conclusion</h4>AARD was diagnosed in less than 1% of all ANA tested patients in university-affiliated hospitals. This result shows that careful consideration before ordering the screening ANA is needed to improve the utility of the test for providers and patients and to reduce health costs spurred by unnecessary testing and its consequences.	2022	Diagnostic Value of Anti-Nuclear Antibodies: Results From Korean University-Affiliated Hospitals.	35578590	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

A set of characteristic parameters were extracted using the repeating unit of the TPU samples and led to prediction of reliable polymer densities (AARD < 6%) and gas solubilities. The viscoelastic parameters, which were obtained from the DMTA analysis, were also estimated the gas diffusion vs. temperature, precisely. The degree of microphase mixing based on the DSC analysis was in order: TPU-1 (4.84 wt%) < TPU-2 (14.16 wt%) < TPU-3 (19.92 wt%). It was found that the TPU-1 membrane had the highest degree of crystallinity, but showed higher gas solubilities and permeabilities because this membrane has the least degree of microphase mixing. These values, in combination with the gas permeation results, showed that the content of the hard segment along with the degree of microphase mixing and other microstructural parameters like crystallinity were the determinative parameters.	2023	A thermodynamic study on relationship between gas separation properties and microstructure of polyurethane membranes.	37055449	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC10198994	10.1038/s41598-023-34900-7	A supercritical fluid, such as supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO<sub>2</sub>) is increasingly used for the micronization of pharmaceuticals in the recent past. The role of scCO<sub>2</sub> as a green solvent in supercritical fluid (SCF) process is decided by the solubility information of the pharmaceutical compound in scCO<sub>2</sub>. The commonly used SCF processes are the rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS) and supercritical antisolvent precipitation (SAS). To implement micronization process, solubility of pharmaceuticals in scCO<sub>2</sub> is required. Present study is aimed at both measuring and modeling of solubilities of hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQS) in scCO<sub>2</sub>. Experiments were conducted at various conditions (P = 12 to 27 MPa and T = 308 to 338 K), for the first time. The measured solubilities were found to be ranging between (0.0304 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and 0.1459 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) at 308 K, (0.0627 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and 0.3158 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) at 318 K, (0.0982 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and 0.4351 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) at 328 K, (0.1398 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and 0.5515 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) at 338 K. To expand the usage of the data, various models were tested. For the modelling task existing models (Chrastil, reformulated Chrastil, Méndez-Santiago and Teja (MST), Bartle et al., Reddy-Garlapati, Sodeifian et al., models) and new set of solvate complex models were considered. Among the all models investigated Reddy-Garlapati and new solvate complex models are able to fit the data with the least error. Finally, the total and solvation enthalpies of HCQS in scCO<sub>2</sub> were calculated with the help of model constants obtained from Chrastil, reformulated Chrastil and Bartle et al., models.	2023	Solubility measurement and modeling of hydroxychloroquine sulfate (antimalarial medication) in supercritical carbon dioxide.	37208371	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9858485	10.3390/diagnostics13020222	The monospecific dense fine speckled (DFS) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) pattern is considered a potential marker to aid in exclusion of antinuclear antibody (ANA)-associated rheumatic diseases (AARD). This pattern is typically produced by autoantibodies against transcription co-activator DFS70/LEDGFp75, which are frequently found in healthy individuals and patients with miscellaneous inflammatory conditions. In AARD patients, these antibodies usually co-exist with disease-associated ANAs. Previous studies reported the occurrence of monospecific autoantibodies that generate a DFS-like or pseudo-DFS IFA pattern but do not react with DFS70/LEDGFp75. We characterized this pattern using confocal microscopy and immunoblotting. The target antigen associated with this pattern partially co-localized with DFS70/LEDGFp75 and its interacting partners H3K36me2, an active chromatin marker, and MLL, a transcription factor, in HEp-2 cells, suggesting a role in transcription. Immunoblotting did not reveal a common protein band immunoreactive with antibodies producing the pseudo-DFS pattern, suggesting they may recognize diverse proteins or conformational epitopes. Given the subjectivity of the HEp-2 IFA test, the awareness of pseudo-DFS autoantibodies reinforces recommendations for confirmatory testing when reporting patient antibodies producing a putative DFS pattern in a clinical setting. Future studies should focus on defining the potential diagnostic utility of the pseudo-DFS pattern and its associated antigen(s).	2023	The Nuclear Dense Fine Speckled (DFS) Immunofluorescence Pattern: Not All Roads Lead to DFS70/LEDGFp75.	36673033	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC10208146	10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.15301	<h4>Importance</h4>Residing in a low-income neighborhood is generally associated with worse pregnancy outcomes. It is not known if moving from a low- to higher-income area between 2 pregnancies alters the risk of adverse birth outcomes in the subsequent birth compared with women who remain in low-income areas for both births.<h4>Objective</h4>To compare the risk of adverse maternal and newborn outcomes among women who achieved upward area-level income mobility vs those who did not.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This population-based cohort study was completed in Ontario, Canada, from 2002 to 2019, where there is universal health care. Included were all nulliparous women with a first-time singleton birth at 20 to 42 weeks' gestation, each residing in a low-income urban neighborhood at the time of the first birth. All women were then assessed at their second birth. Statistical analysis was conducted from August 2022 to April 2023.<h4>Exposure</h4>Movement from a lowest-income quintile (Q1) neighborhood to any higher-income quintile neighborhood (Q2-Q5) between the first and second birth.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The maternal outcome was severe maternal morbidity or mortality (SMM-M) at the second birth hospitalization or up to 42 days post partum. The primary perinatal outcome was severe neonatal morbidity or mortality (SNM-M) within 27 days of the second birth. Relative risks (aRR) and absolute risk differences (aARD) were estimated by adjusting for maternal and infant characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 42 208 (44.1%) women (mean [SD] age at second birth, 30.0 [5.2] years) experienced upward area-level income mobility, and 53 409 (55.9%) women (age at second birth, 29.0 [5.4] years) remained in income Q1 between births. Relative to women who remained in income Q1 between births, those with upward mobility had a lower associated risk of SMM-M (12.0 vs 13.3 per 1000 births), with an aRR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.93) and aARD of -2.09 per 1000 (95% CI, -3.1 to -0.9 per 1000 ). Likewise, their newborns experienced lower respective rates of SNM-M (48.0 vs 50.9 per 1000 live births), with an aRR of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87 to 0.95) and aARD of -4.7 per 1000 (95% CI, -6.8 to -2.6 per 1000).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>In this cohort study of nulliparous women living in low-income areas, those who moved to a higher-income area between births experienced less morbidity and death in their second pregnancy, as did their newborns, compared with those who remained in low-income areas between births. Research is needed to determine whether financial incentives or enhancement of neighborhood factors can reduce adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.	2023	Neighborhood Income Mobility and Risk of Neonatal and Maternal Morbidity.	37219900	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9699495	10.3390/membranes12111147	This study compares the predictive performance of different classes of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) in predicting the permeability of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in mixed matrix membrane (MMM) containing the SAPO-34 zeolite. The hybrid neuro-fuzzy technique uses the MMM chemistry, pressure, and temperature to estimate CO<sub>2</sub> permeability. Indeed, grid partitioning (GP), fuzzy C-means (FCM), and subtractive clustering (SC) strategies are used to divide the input space of ANFIS. Statistical analyses compare the performance of these strategies, and the spider graph technique selects the best one. As a result of the prediction of more than 100 experimental samples, the ANFIS with the subtractive clustering method shows better accuracy than the other classes. The hybrid optimization algorithm and cluster radius = 0.55 are the best hyperparameters of this ANFIS model. This neuro-fuzzy model predicts the experimental database with an absolute average relative deviation (AARD) of less than 3% and a correlation of determination higher than 0.995. Such an intelligent model is not only straightforward but also helps to find the best MMM chemistry and operating conditions to maximize CO<sub>2</sub> separation.	2022	Developing a Hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy Method to Predict Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) Permeability in Mixed Matrix Membranes Containing SAPO-34 Zeolite.	36422139	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

The high solubility of the invaded gas in drilling fluid makes the gas invasion monitoring ""hidden"" and ""sudden"" for later expansion, and the blowout risk increases. Accurate prediction of gas dissolution is highly significant for monitoring gas invasion. In this study, the gas-liquid flow control equations considering gas dissolution were established. Focusing on the gas dissolution effect, a solubility experiment for CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> in an aqueous solution was performed using a phase equilibrium device. The experimental and simulation results revealed that the addition of CO<sub>2</sub> can significantly increase gas dissolution, and the presence of salts decreases it. For solubility prediction of pure CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, the fugacity-activity solubility model, calculated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state, was more accurate than the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state. The Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state has higher accuracy for the CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> gas mixture.

PMC10099143	10.1021/acsomega.3c00436	One of the most commonly used molecular inputs for ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) in the literature are the critical properties and acentric factors, which can be easily determined using the modified Lydersen-Joback-Reid (LJR) method with Lee-Kesler mixing rules. However, the method used in the literature is generally applicable only to binary mixtures of DESs. Nevertheless, ternary DESs are considered to be more interesting and may provide further tailorability for developing task-specific DESs for particular applications. Therefore, in this work, a new framework for estimating the critical properties and the acentric factor of ternary DESs based on their molecular structures is presented by adjusting the framework reported in the literature with an extended version of the Lee-Kesler mixing rules. The presented framework was applied to a data set consisting of 87 ternary DESs with 334 distinct compositions. For validation, the estimated critical properties and acentric factors were used to predict the densities of the ternary DESs. The results showed excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated data, with an average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 5.203% for ternary DESs and 5.712% for 260 binary DESs (573 compositions). The developed methodology was incorporated into a user-friendly Excel worksheet for computing the critical properties and acentric factors of any ternary or binary DES, which is provided in the Supporting Information. This work promotes the creation of robust, accessible, and user-friendly models capable of predicting the properties of new ternary DESs based on critical properties, thus saving time and resources.	2023	Critical Properties of Ternary Deep Eutectic Solvents Using Group Contribution with Extended Lee-Kesler Mixing Rules.	37065032	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
NA	10.1111/mec.16973	The environment experienced during early life is a crucial factor in the life of many organisms. This early life environment has been shown to have profound effects on morphology, physiology and fitness. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects are largely unknown, even though they are essential for our understanding of the processes that induce phenotypic variation in natural populations. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that has been suggested to explain such environmentally induced phenotypic changes early in life. To investigate whether DNA methylation changes are associated with experimentally induced early developmental effects, we cross-fostered great tit (Parus major) nestlings and manipulated their brood sizes in a natural study population. We assessed experimental brood size effects on pre-fledging biometry and behaviour. We linked this to genome-wide DNA methylation levels of CpG sites in erythrocyte DNA, using 122 individuals and an improved epiGBS2 laboratory protocol. Brood enlargement caused developmental stress and negatively affected nestling condition, predominantly during the second half of the breeding season, when conditions are harsher. Brood enlargement, however, affected nestling DNA methylation in only one CpG site and only if the hatch date was taken into account. In conclusion, this study shows that nutritional stress in enlarged broods does not associate with direct effects on genome-wide DNA methylation. Future studies should assess whether genome-wide DNA methylation variation may arise later in life as a consequence of phenotypic changes during early development.	2023	Developmental stress does not induce genome-wide DNA methylation changes in wild great tit (Parus major) nestlings.	37154074	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
NA	10.1088/1758-5090/ace07f	To progress cardiac tissue engineering strategies closer to the clinic, thicker constructs are required to meet the functional need following a cardiac event. Consequently, pre-vascularization of these constructs needs to be investigated to ensure survival and optimal performance of implantable engineered heart tissue. The aim of this research is to investigate the potential of combining extrusion-based bioprinting and melt electrowriting for the fabrication of a myocardial construct with a precisely patterned pre-vascular pathway. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) was investigated as a base hydrogel for the respective myocardial and vascular bioinks with collagen, Matrigel and fibrinogen as interpenetrating polymers to support myocardial functionality. Subsequently, extrusion-based printability and viability were investigated to determine the optimal processing parameters for printing into melt electrowritten meshes. Finally, an anatomically inspired vascular pathway was implemented in a dual extrusion-based bioprinting set-up into melt electrowritten meshes, creating a patterned pre-vascularized myocardial construct. It was determined that a blend of 5% GelMA and 0.8 mgmL-1 collagen with a low crosslinked density was optimal for myocardial cellular arrangement and alignment within the constructs. For the vascular fraction, the optimized formulation consisted of 5% GelMA, 0.8 mgmL-1 collagen and 1 mgmL-1 fibrinogen with a higher crosslinked density, which led to enhanced vascular cell connectivity. Printability assessment confirmed that the optimized bioinks could effectively fill the microfiber mesh while supporting cell viability (~70%). Finally, the two bioinks were applied using a dual extrusion-based bioprinting system for the fabrication of a pre-vascular pathway with the shape of a left anterior descending artery within a myocardial construct, whereby the distinct cell populations could be visualized in their respective patterns for up to 14 days in culture. This research investigated the first step towards developing a thick engineered cardiac tissue construct in which a pre-vascularization pathway is fabricated within a myocardial construct.	2023	Convergence of melt electrowriting and extrusion-based bioprinting for vascular patterning of a myocardial construct.	37343567	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9705479	10.1038/s41598-022-24689-2	The production of phosphoric acid by dehydrated process leads to the precipitation of unwanted insoluble salts promoting thus the crystallization fouling build-up on heat transfer surfaces of the exchangers. During the acid concentration operation, the presence of fouling in heat exchangers results in reducing the performance of this equipment, in terms of heat transfer, while increasing energy losses and damaging the apparatus. To mitigate these adverse effects of fouling, it is necessary to forecast the thermal resistance of fouling to schedule and perform exchanger cleaning. In this context, artificial neural network and response surface methodology were used to estimate thermal resistance of fouling in a cross-flow heat exchanger by using the operating data of the concentration loop. The absolute average relative deviations, mean squared errors, root mean squared errors and correlation coefficients were used as indicators error between the experimental and estimated values for both methods. The best fitted model derived from response surface methodology method was second order polynomial while the best architecture topology, for the artificial neural network method, consists of three layers: input layer with six input variables, hidden layer with six hidden neurons and an output layer with single output variable. The interactive influences of operating parameters which have significant effects on the fouling resistance were illustrated in detail. The value of correlation coefficient for the output parameter from the response surface methodology is 0.9976, indicating that the response surface methodology as an assessment methodology in estimating fouling resistance is more feasible compared with the artificial neural network approach.	2022	Analysis and estimation of cross-flow heat exchanger fouling in phosphoric acid concentration plant using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN).	36443423	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC10195877	10.1038/s41598-023-35320-3	Gas injection can increase oil recovery because the gas-oil interfacial tension is less than the water-oil interfacial tension (IFT) and tends to zero in the miscibility state. However, little information has been provided on the gas-oil movement and penetration mechanisms in the fracture system at the porosity scale. The IFT of oil and gas in the porous medium changes and can control oil recovery. In this study, the IFT and the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) are calculated using the cubic Peng-Robinson equation of state that has been modified using the mean pore radius and capillary pressure. The calculated IFT and MMP change with the pore radius and capillary pressure. To investigate the effect of a porous medium on the IFT during the injection of CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub> in the presence of n-alkanes and for validation, measured experimental values in references have been used. According to the results of this paper, changes in IFT vary in terms of pressure in the presence of different gases and, the proposed model has good accuracy for measuring the IFT and the MMP during the injection of hydrocarbon gases and CO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, as the average radius of the pores gets smaller, the interfacial tension tends to lower values. This effect is different with increasing the mean size of interstice in two different intervals. In the first interval, i.e. the R<sub>p</sub> from 10 to 5000 nm, the IFT changes from 3 to 10.78 mN/m and in the second interval, i.e. the R<sub>p</sub> from 5000 nm to infinity, the IFT changes from 10.78 to 10.85 mN/m. In other words, increasing the diameter of the porous medium to a certain threshold (i.e. 5000 nm) increases the IFT. As a rule, changes in IFT affected by exposure to a porous medium affect the values of the MMP. In general, IFT decreases in very fine porous media, causing miscibility at lower pressures.	2023	Calculation of IFT in porous media in the presence of different gas and normal alkanes using the modified EoS.	37202448	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

An approach based on van der Waals and Platteeuw model is undertaken and the estimates are quantified in terms of percent average absolute relative deviations (% AARD). An average AARD of 1.75% and 2.68% is observed in pure and aqueous electrolytic phase of NaCl, KCl, CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The model predictions are then estimated at temperature/salinity of 281 K/0 wt% and 284 K/3.5 wt%. Together with the qualitative assessment of the hydrate phase, viz, vapor pressure, compressibility and dissociation enthalpy, R152a refrigerant is observed to be the appropriate former for applications to both load management and desalination.	2022	A thermodynamic framework to identify apposite refrigerant former for hydrate-based applications.	36202830	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC8980602	10.3389/fped.2022.839928	<h4>Introduction</h4>Anti-DFS70 antibodies occur in healthy individuals with various medical conditions. Unlike other anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA), they are not associated with systemic autoimmune disease in adult patients. To date, only a few studies have addressed the prevalence and/or clinical relevance of anti-DFS70 autoantibodies in children with and without autoimmune disease.<h4>Methods</h4>Included in this retrospective cross-sectional mono-centric study were 308 pediatric patients with suspected or known autoimmune conditions who had a positive ANA in indirect immune fluorescence (IIF) screening and who were screened for anti-DFS70 antibodies by extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA) immunoblot. Patients were assigned to four different diagnostic categories according to their diagnosis in the corresponding medical record: (a) absence of autoimmune or rheumatic disease (noARD, <i>n</i> = 116); (b) suspected autoimmunity without definitive diagnosis (sAI, <i>n</i> = 48); (c) other rheumatic disease (ORD) (<i>n</i> = 115); and (d) ANA-associated autoimmune disease (AARD, <i>n</i> = 29).<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of anti-DFS70 antibodies in the overall cohort was 33.8%. Among children without ARD (46.6%, 54/116), prevalence was significantly higher than among children with ORD (23.7%, 27/115, <i>p</i> = 0.0003) or AARD (17.2%, 5/29, <i>p</i> = 0.0054). Among all of the anti-DFS70 positive patients with AARD, other autoantibodies were found in the ENA immunoblot. In contrast, among anti-DFS70 positive patients with ORD (11.5%, 4/27), sAI (33.3%, 6/18) and noARD (16.7%, 9/54), other autoantibodies infrequently were detected (<i>p</i> = 0.0005). Patients with uveitis rarely were positive for anti-DFS70 antibodies (7.7%, 1/13). No association was found between anti-DFS70 antibodies and a history of allergic conditions (<i>p</i> = 0.51). The concordance between a typical DFS pattern in IIF and the detection of anti-DFS70 antibodies by immunoblot was 59.3%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As with adults, the higher prevalence of anti-DFS70 among children without autoimmune disease confirms the mutual exclusion for this autoantibody in the pathogenesis of ARD. Among ANA-positive children, monospecific anti-DFS70 antibodies may help to discriminate between AARD and not-AARD-related conditions.	2022	Low Prevalence of Anti-DFS70 Antibodies in Children With ANA-Associated Autoimmune Disease.	35391747	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9174250	10.1038/s41598-022-13233-x	This study introduces a universal correlation based on the modified version of the Arrhenius equation to estimate the solubility of anti-cancer drugs in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). A combination of an Arrhenius-shape term and a departure function was proposed to estimate the solubility of anti-cancer drugs in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>. This modified Arrhenius correlation predicts the solubility of anti-cancer drugs in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> from pressure, temperature, and carbon dioxide density. The pre-exponential of the Arrhenius linearly relates to the temperature and carbon dioxide density, and its exponential term is an inverse function of pressure. Moreover, the departure function linearly correlates with the natural logarithm of the ratio of carbon dioxide density to the temperature. The reliability of the proposed correlation is validated using all literature data for solubility of anti-cancer drugs in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the predictive performance of the modified Arrhenius correlation is compared with ten available empirical correlations in the literature. Our developed correlation presents the absolute average relative deviation (AARD) of 9.54% for predicting 316 experimental measurements. On the other hand, the most accurate correlation in the literature presents the AARD = 14.90% over the same database. Indeed, 56.2% accuracy improvement in the solubility prediction of the anti-cancer drugs in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> is the primary outcome of the current study.	2022	Developing an accurate empirical correlation for predicting anti-cancer drugs' dissolution in supercritical carbon dioxide.	35672349	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9581934	10.1038/s41598-022-22366-y	Measurement of saturation solubility of drugs in a supercritical fluid is an important parameter for the implementation of supercritical technology in pharmaceutical industry. CO<sub>2</sub> is the most sorted substance as a supercritical fluid since it has attractive properties like easily achievable critical temperature, moderate pressure. Cancer is increasingly affecting the mankind, a proper dosage while treating would help in minimizing the drug usage. The bioavailability of the drug is mainly influenced by the drug particle size. An appropriate technology is always useful in making suitable drug particles; thus, supercritical fluid technology (SFT) is considered as promising technique for the production of micro and nanoparticles. Since, particle production process through SFT needs solubility information, appropriate solubility information is necessary. In the present work, Crizotinib (anti-cancer drug) solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO<sub>2</sub>) is measured and reported, for the first time. The obtained solubilities are at temperatures 308, 318, 328,338 K and pressures 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 to 27 MPa. The measured solubilities are ranged in terms of mole fraction from (0.483 × 10<sup>-5</sup> to 0.791 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) at 308 K, (0.315 × 10<sup>-5</sup> to 0.958 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) at 318 K, (0.26 × 10<sup>-5</sup> to 1.057 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) at 328 K, (0.156 × 10<sup>-5</sup> to 1.219 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) at 338 K. The cross over region is observed at 14.5 MPa. To expand the application of the solubility data, few important solubility models and three cubic equations of sate (cubic EoS) models along with Kwak and Mansoori mixing rules are investigated. Sublimation and salvation enthalpies of Crizotinib dissolution in scCO<sub>2</sub> are calculated.	2022	Experimental solubility and modeling of Crizotinib (anti-cancer medication) in supercritical carbon dioxide.	36261497	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
NA	10.21203/rs.3.rs-1100319/v1	The modeling of the permeate flux of a rotating disk membrane (RDM) filtration was investigated in this paper. Two computational intelligence techniques namely artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to model the permeate flux based on seven input variables including time of filtration, concentration of the feed fluid, transmembrane pressure, rotating velocity, dynamic velocity of the feed fluid, pore diameter of the membrane and, density of the feed fluid. The best-fit model was selected through the trial-error method and the two statistical parameters including the coefficient of determination (R²) and the average absolute relative deviation (AARD) between experimental and predicted data. The results obtained showed that the optimized ANN model can predict the permeate flux with R² = 0.999 and AARD% = 2.245 versus the SVM model with R² = 0.996 and AARD% = 4.09. Furthermore, the ANN model showed a high ability to predict the permeate flux in comparison with the SVM approach. The applicability domain of the ANN model was conducted to identify the outliers of the database and, the sensibility analysis of inputs on the output was employed for the determination of the relevant input variables.	2022	A new approach using artificial neural network and support vector machine models to predict the permeate flux of a rotating disk membrane	NA	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

The model using D<sub>2</sub>Q<sub>9</sub> (two dimensions and 9 speed) lattice solves the two-dimensional space, convection-dispersion adsorption model for the CO<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub> mixture in rich H<sub>2</sub> at transient condition. The sink/source term model was considered as the adsorption/desorption kinetic rate based on Extended Langmuir theory for multicomponent mixture. The mole balances in the solid phase were considered as the lumped kinetic model of adsorption-desorption reaction. The results of the developed model was presented as the flow velocity and molar fractions of the components in axial and radial directions of the bed as well as breakthrough curves of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> from their mixture in H<sub>2</sub> gas stream under pressures of 3 and 5 bar and inlet linear velocities of 0.01, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.1m/min. The breakthrough curves were validated with the experimental data and the average absolute relative deviations (AARD) were calculated for both components. In addition, the results of LBM were compared with finite difference method in which AARDs were dtermined as 3% and 8% for CO<sub>2</sub>,4% and 7% for CH<sub>4</sub> , by LBM and FDM, respectively.	2023	Investigation of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> capture from syngas in adsorption process and breakthrough modeling by modified Lattice-Boltzmann mesoscale method.	36914010	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9640585	10.1038/s41598-022-21233-0	Computational analysis of drug solubility was carried out using machine learning approach. The solubility of Decitabine as model drug in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> was studied as function of pressure and temperature to assess the feasibility of that for production of nanomedicine to enhance the solubility. The data was collected for solubility optimization of Decitabine at the temperature 308-338 K, and pressure 120-400 bar used as the inputs to the machine learning models. A dataset of 32 data points and two inputs (P and T) have been applied to optimize the solubility. The only output is Y = solubility, which is Decitabine mole fraction solubility in the solvent. The developed models are three models including Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Decision tree Regression (DTR), and Gaussian process (GPR), which are used for the first time as a novel model. These models are optimized using their hyper-parameters tuning and then assessed using standard metrics, which shows R<sup>2</sup>-score, KRR, DTR, and GPR equal to 0.806, 0.891, and 0.998. Also, the MAE metric shows 1.08E-04, 7.40E-05, and 9.73E-06 error rates in the same order. The other metric is MAPE, in which the KRR error rate is 4.64E-01, DTR shows an error rate equal to 1.63E-01, and GPR as the best mode illustrates 5.06E-02. Finally, analysis using the best model (GPR) reveals that increasing both inputs results in an increase in the solubility of Decitabine. The optimal values are (P = 400, T = 3.38E + 02, Y = 1.07E-03).	2022	Computational simulation and target prediction studies of solubility optimization of decitabine through supercritical solvent.	36344531	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9187726	10.1038/s41598-022-13720-1	This study uses the differential evolution optimization algorithm to adjust the coefficient of Arrhenius-shape correlation for calculating hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) solubility in alcohol-based media. The pre-exponential and exponential parts of this correlation are the functions of pressure and absolute temperature, respectively. Since this model has been validated using seventeen alcohol/hydrogen binary mixtures, it is the most generalized correlation in this regard. The proposed Arrhenius-shape correlation predicts 285 laboratory solubility measurements with the absolute average relative deviation (AARD%) of 3.28% and regression coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.99589. The accuracy of the developed model has also been compared with two empirical correlations and three equations of state suggested in the literature. The Arrhenius-shape model has 15% and 50% smaller AARD than the most accurate empirical correlation and equation of state, respectively. Simulation findings demonstrate that all alcohol/hydrogen mixtures thermodynamically behave based on Henry's law. Hydrogen solubility in alcohols increases by increasing either pressure or temperature. 1-octanol has the maximum ability to absorb the H<sub>2</sub> molecules.	2022	Development of a reliable empirical correlation to calculate hydrogen solubility in seventeen alcoholic media.	35689030	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

The WT-ANN has been constructed to extract the sensor resistance ratio (SRR) in the air with respect to the acetone from the nanocomposite chemistry, operating temperature, and acetone concentration. The performed sensitivity analyses demonstrate that a single hidden layer WT-ANN with nine nodes is the highest accurate model for automating the acetone-detecting ability of the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> sensors. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm has fine-tuned the shape-related parameters of the B-spline wavelet transfer function. This model accurately predicts the SRR of the 119 nanocomposite sensors with a mean absolute error of 0.7, absolute average relative deviation of 10.12%, root mean squared error of 1.14, and correlation coefficient of 0.95813. The In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-based nanocomposite with a 15 mol percent of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is the best sensor for detecting acetone at wide temperatures and concentration ranges.

PMC9395712	10.3389/fchem.2022.909485	Having been introduced in 2003, Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) make up a most recent category of green solvents. Due to their unique characteristics, and also their tunable physical properties, DESs have shown high potentials for use in various applications. One of the investigated applications is CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. The thermodynamic modeling of CO<sub>2</sub> solubility in DESs has been pursued by a number of researchers to estimate the capacity and capability of DESs for such tasks. Among the advanced equations of state (EoSs), the Perturbed Chain-Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) is a well-known EoS. In this study, the performance of the PC-SAFT EoS for estimating CO<sub>2</sub> solubility in various DESs, within wide ranges of temperatures and pressures, was investigated. A large data bank, including 2542 CO<sub>2</sub> solubility data in 109 various-natured DESs was developed and used for this study. This is currently the most comprehensive study in the open literature on CO<sub>2</sub> solubility in DESs using an EoS. For modeling, the DES was considered as a pseudo-component with a 2B association scheme. CO<sub>2</sub> was considered as both an inert and a 2B-component and the results of each association scheme were compared. Considering the very challenging task of modeling a complex hydrogen bonding mixture with gases, the results of AARD% being lower than 10% for both of the investigated association schemes of CO<sub>2</sub>, showed that PC-SAFT is a suitable model for estimating CO<sub>2</sub> solubilities in various DESs. Also, by proposing generalized correlations to predict the PC-SAFT parameters, covering different families of DESs, the developed model provides a global technique to estimate CO<sub>2</sub> solubilities in new and upcoming DESs, avoiding the necessity of further experimental work. This can be most valuable for screening and feasibility studies to select potential DESs from the innumerable options available.	2022	Investigation of carbon dioxide solubility in various families of deep eutectic solvents by the PC-SAFT EoS.	36017164	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9370217	10.3390/molecules27154896	Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are an important class of green solvents that have been developed as an alternative to toxic solvents. However, the large-scale industrial application of DESs requires fine-tuning their physicochemical properties. Among others, surface tension is one of such properties that have to be considered while designing novel DESs. In this work, we present the results of a detailed evaluation of Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR) modeling efforts designed to predict the surface tension of DESs, following the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. The data set used comprises a large number of structurally diverse binary DESs and the models were built systematically through rigorous validation methods, including 'mixtures-out'- and 'compounds-out'-based data splitting. The most predictive individual QSPR model found is shown to be statistically robust, besides providing valuable information about the structural and physicochemical features responsible for the surface tension of DESs. Furthermore, the intelligent consensus prediction strategy applied to multiple predictive models led to consensus models with similar statistical robustness to the individual QSPR model. The benefits of the present work stand out also from its reproducibility since it relies on fully specified computational procedures and on publicly available tools. Finally, our results not only guide the future design and screening of novel DESs with a desirable surface tension but also lays out strategies for efficiently setting up silico-based models for binary mixtures.	2022	Predicting the Surface Tension of Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Step Forward in the Use of Greener Solvents.	35956845	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9660063	10.21037/jgo-22-962	<h4>Background</h4>N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant form of methylation modification in eukaryotic cell messenger RNA (mRNA). However, the role of m6A in gastric cancer (GC), which is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies, is unclear. In this study, m6A-relevant mRNA signatures and risk scores were determined to predict the prognosis of GC.<h4>Methods</h4>The expression profiles and clinical information of 367 patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Cluster analysis and univariate Cox analysis were performed to identify the regulatory factors of RNA methylation associated with GC prognosis. A co-expression network was constructed using the WGCNA package in R. The correlations between module eigengenes and clinical traits were then calculated to identify the relevant modules. We used univariate Cox analysis to screen for genes that are significantly associated with prognosis in the module. We identified hub genes by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate analysis and developed a Cox prognostic model. Finally, the hub gene expression values weighted by the coefficients from the LASSO regression were applied to generate a risk score for each patient, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess the prognostic capacity of the risk scores. The asporin (<i>ASPN</i>) gene in GC cell lines was verified via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. Moreover, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and transwell assays were applied to evaluate the effects of the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities in GC cells after ASPN knockdown. Western blot verified the effects of <i>ASPN</i> on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway-related gene expression.<h4>Results</h4>Our results indicated that <i>AARD, ASPN, SLAMF9, MIR3117</i> and <i>DUSP1</i> were hub genes affecting the prognosis of GC patients. Besides, we found that <i>ASPN</i> expression was upregulated in GC cells. The knockdown of <i>ASPN</i> expression suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by deactivating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and EMT pathways, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings indicated that <i>ASPN</i> participates in the biological process of GC as an oncogene and may be a promising biomarker in GC.	2022	Identification of a five m6A-relevant mRNAs signature and risk score for the prognostication of gastric cancer.	36388685	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

Here we report the histories of several enslaved women, who escaped in the early periods of slave rebellion in Suriname. They played a crucial role in ensuring food security for their runaway communities by bringing rice seeds hidden in their hair. We combined information from ethnobotanical surveys, Maroon oral history, archival documents and published accounts to show how Maroon farmers safeguard their agricultural diversity and cultural heritage by cultivating rice varieties that still carry the names of their female ancestors who took along these seeds during their flight to freedom. We trace the routes of the Saramaccan ancestors Sééi, Yaya and Paánza, Tjowa of the Matawai, Sapali, Ana and Bapi of the Aucans, and describe the rice varieties named after them. The legends of these female ancestors acknowledge the importance of women in Maroon survival.

PMC9338076	10.1038/s41598-022-15081-1	Somatic mutations and changes in expression of RAD21 are common in many types of cancer. Moreover, sub-optimal levels of RAD21 expression in early development can result in cohesinopathies. Altered RAD21 levels can result directly from mutations in the RAD21 gene. However, whether DNA variants outside of the RAD21 gene could control its expression and thereby contribute to cancer and developmental disease is unknown. In this study, we searched for genomic variants that modify RAD21expression to determine their potential to contribute to development or cancer by RAD21 dysregulation. We searched 42,953,834 genomic variants for a spatial-eQTL association with the transcription of RAD21. We identified 123 significant associations (FDR < 0.05), which are local (cis) or long-distance (trans) regulators of RAD21 expression. The 123 variants co-regulate a further seven genes (AARD, AKAP11, GRID1, KCNIP4, RCN1, TRIOBP, and USP32), enriched for having Sp2 transcription factor binding sites in their promoter regions. The Sp2 transcription factor and six of the seven genes had previously been associated with cancer onset, progression, and metastasis. Our results suggest that genome-wide variation in non-coding regions impacts on RAD21 transcript levels in addition to other genes, which then could impact on oncogenesis and the process of ubiquitination. This identification of distant co-regulation of oncogenes represents a strategy for discovery of novel genetic regions influencing cancer onset and a potential for diagnostics.	2022	Genetic variation as a long-distance modulator of RAD21 expression in humans.	35906355	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

PMC9416672	10.3390/pharmaceutics14081632	Synthesizing micro-/nano-sized pharmaceutical compounds with an appropriate size distribution is a method often followed to enhance drug delivery and reduce side effects. Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) is a well-known solvent utilized in the pharmaceutical synthesis process. Reliable knowledge of a drug's solubility in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> is necessary for feasible study, modeling, design, optimization, and control of such a process. Therefore, the current study constructs a stacked/ensemble model by combining three up-to-date machine learning tools (i.e., extra tree, gradient boosting, and random forest) to predict the solubility of twelve anticancer drugs in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>. An experimental databank comprising 311 phase equilibrium samples was gathered from the literature and applied to design the proposed stacked model. This model estimates the solubility of anticancer drugs in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as a function of solute and solvent properties and operating conditions. Several statistical indices, including average absolute relative deviation (<i>AARD</i> = 8.62%), mean absolute error (<i>MAE</i> = 2.86 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), relative absolute error (<i>RAE</i> = 2.42%), mean squared error (<i>MSE</i> = 1.26 × 10<sup>-10</sup>), and regression coefficient (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.99809) were used to validate the performance of the constructed model. The statistical, sensitivity, and trend analyses confirmed that the suggested stacked model demonstrates excellent performance for correlating and predicting the solubility of anticancer drugs in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>.	2022	Estimating the Dissolution of Anticancer Drugs in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide with a Stacked Machine Learning Model.	36015258	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

NA	10.1007/s12311-022-01499-w	The cerebellum is involved in many motor, autonomic and cognitive functions, and new tasks that have a cerebellar contribution are discovered on a regular basis. Simultaneously, our insight into the functional compartmentalization of the cerebellum has markedly improved. Additionally, studies on cerebellar output pathways have seen a renaissance due to the development of viral tracing techniques. To create an overview of the current state of our understanding of cerebellar efferents, we undertook a systematic review of all studies on monosynaptic projections from the cerebellum to the brainstem and the diencephalon in mammals. This revealed that important projections from the cerebellum, to the motor nuclei, cerebral cortex, and basal ganglia, are predominantly di- or polysynaptic, rather than monosynaptic. Strikingly, most target areas receive cerebellar input from all three cerebellar nuclei, showing a convergence of cerebellar information at the output level. Overall, there appeared to be a large level of agreement between studies on different species as well as on the use of different types of neural tracers, making the emerging picture of the cerebellar output areas a solid one. Finally, we discuss how this cerebellar output network is affected by a range of diseases and syndromes, with also non-cerebellar diseases having impact on cerebellar output areas.	2022	A Systematic Review of Direct Outputs from the Cerebellum to the Brainstem and Diencephalon in Mammals.	36575348	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
NA	10.1073/pnas.2218565120	A long-standing topic of interest in human neurosciences is the understanding of the neurobiology underlying human cognition. Less commonly considered is to what extent such systems may be shared with other species. We examined individual variation in brain connectivity in the context of cognitive abilities in chimpanzees (<i>n</i> = 45) and humans in search of a conserved link between cognition and brain connectivity across the two species. Cognitive scores were assessed on a variety of behavioral tasks using chimpanzee- and human-specific cognitive test batteries, measuring aspects of cognition related to relational reasoning, processing speed, and problem solving in both species. We show that chimpanzees scoring higher on such cognitive skills display relatively strong connectivity among brain networks also associated with comparable cognitive abilities in the human group. We also identified divergence in brain networks that serve specialized functions across humans and chimpanzees, such as stronger language connectivity in humans and relatively more prominent connectivity between regions related to spatial working memory in chimpanzees. Our findings suggest that core neural systems of cognition may have evolved before the divergence of chimpanzees and humans, along with potential differential investments in other brain networks relating to specific functional specializations between the two species.	2023	Human and chimpanzee shared and divergent neurobiological systems for general and specific cognitive brain functions.	37216540	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

NA	10.1177/08850666221107839	<h4>Objective</h4>In many institutions, intensive care unit (ICU) nurses assess their patients' muscle function as part of their routine bedside examination. We tested the research hypothesis that this subjective examination of muscle function prior to extubation predicts tracheostomy requirement.<h4>Methods</h4>Adult, mechanically ventilated patients admitted to 7 ICUs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) between 2008 and 2019 were included in this observational study. Assessment of motor function was performed every four hours by ICU nurses. Multivariable logistic regression analysis controlled for acute disease severity, delirium risk assessment through the confusion assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), and pre-defined predictors of extubation failure was applied to examine the association of motor function and tracheostomy within 30 days after extubation.<h4>Results</h4>Within 30 days after extubation, 891 of 9609 (9.3%) included patients required a tracheostomy. The inability to spontaneously move and hold extremities against gravity within 24 h prior to extubation was associated with significantly higher odds of 30-day tracheostomy (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.27-1.91, p < 0.001, adjusted absolute risk difference (aARD) 2.8% (p < 0.001)). The effect was magnified among patients who were mechanically ventilated for >7 days (aARD 21.8%, 95% CI 12.4-31.2%, p-for-interaction = 0.015).<h4>Conclusions</h4>ICU nurses' subjective assessment of motor function is associated with 30-day tracheostomy risk, independent of known risk factors. Muscle function measurements by nursing staff in the ICU should be discussed during interprofessional rounds.	2023	Subjective Assessment of Motor Function by the Bedside Nurses in Mechanically Ventilated Surgical Intensive Care Unit Patients Predicts Tracheostomy.	35695208	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

Using organic soil amendments has been suggested to stimulate the abundance and/or activity of beneficial indigenous microbes in the soil. Residual streams from insect farming (frass and exuviae) contain chitin and other compounds that may stimulate beneficial soil microbes that have ISR and biocontrol activity. Additionally, changes in plant phenotype that are induced by beneficial microorganisms may directly influence plant-pollinator interactions, thus affecting plant reproduction.

PMC8924225	10.1038/s41598-022-08304-y	Absorption has always been an attractive process for removing hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). Posing unique properties and promising removal capacity, ionic liquids (ILs) are potential media for H<sub>2</sub>S capture. Engineering design of such absorption process needs accurate measurements or reliable estimation of the H<sub>2</sub>S solubility in ILs. Since experimental measurements are time-consuming and expensive, this study utilizes machine learning methods to monitor H<sub>2</sub>S solubility in fifteen various ILs accurately. Six robust machine learning methods, including adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), radial basis function, cascade, multilayer perceptron, and generalized regression neural networks, are implemented/compared. A vast experimental databank comprising 792 datasets was utilized. Temperature, pressure, acentric factor, critical pressure, and critical temperature of investigated ILs are the affecting parameters of our models. Sensitivity and statistical error analysis were utilized to assess the performance and accuracy of the proposed models. The calculated solubility data and the derived models were validated using seven statistical criteria. The obtained results showed that the LS-SVM accurately predicts H<sub>2</sub>S solubility in ILs and possesses R<sup>2</sup>, RMSE, MSE, RRSE, RAE, MAE, and AARD of 0.99798, 0.01079, 0.00012, 6.35%, 4.35%, 0.0060, and 4.03, respectively. It was found that the H<sub>2</sub>S solubility adversely relates to the temperature and directly depends on the pressure. Furthermore, the combination of OMIM<sup>+</sup> and Tf<sub>2</sub>N<sup>-</sup>, i.e., [OMIM][Tf<sub>2</sub>N] ionic liquid, is the best choice for H<sub>2</sub>S capture among the investigated absorbents. The H<sub>2</sub>S solubility in this ionic liquid can reach more than 0.8 in terms of mole fraction.	2022	A modeling approach for estimating hydrogen sulfide solubility in fifteen different imidazole-based ionic liquids.	35292713	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol
PMC9675731	10.1038/s41598-022-23722-8	Activated carbons are used in industrial applications; their cost is a major barrier to their more widespread application. Regeneration of activated carbons is indispensable to minimize operational costs and product wastage. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO<sub>2</sub>) as green technology was used to regenerate activated carbons. In this work, response surface methodology was employed to optimize the supercritical regeneration process and to evaluate the effect of the operational parameters including pressure (100-300 bar), temperature (313-333 K), flow rate (2-6 g/min), and dynamic time (30-150 min) on the regeneration yield. The maximum regeneration yield (93.71%) was achieved at 285 bar, 333 K, 4 g/min, and 147 min. Mathematical modeling was done using two one-parameter kinetics models, which agree well with the experimental data. The fitting parameter of the model was obtained by using a differential evolution algorithm. The chemical composition of the substances extracted from the activated carbon was identified by gas chromatography. The results showed that the regeneration of activated carbon by SC-CO<sub>2</sub> can be an alternative method to conventional methods.	2022	Separation of hydrocarbons from activated carbon as a porous substance in a glycol regeneration process using supercritical carbon dioxide.	36402795	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

In this work, solubility of solid pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate in ScCO<sub>2</sub> is determined and reported at 308, 318, 328 and 338 K and at pressures between 12 and 27 MPa. The solubilities are ranged between 0.0301 [Formula: see text] 10<sup>-4</sup> and 0.463 [Formula: see text] 10<sup>-4</sup> in mole fraction. The determined solubilities are modelled with a new model using solid-liquid equilibrium criteria and the required activity coefficient is developed using regular solution theory. The measured solubilities data are also modelled with three recent and four conventional empirical models. The recent models used are, Alwi-Garlapati (AARD = 13.1%), Sodeifian et al.

The proposed model is correlating the data with less than 14.9% and 16.23% in terms of AARD for temperature dependent and independent cases.

PMC9335917	10.1021/acscentsci.2c00157	The lack of accurate methods for predicting the viscosity of solvent materials, especially those with complex interactions, remains unresolved. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), an emerging class of green solvents, have a severe lack of viscosity data, resulting in their application still staying at the stage of random trial and error, and it is difficult for them to be implemented on an industrial scale. In this work, we demonstrate the successful prediction of the viscosity of DESs based on the transition state theory-inspired neural network (TSTiNet). The TSTiNet adopts multilayer perceptron (MLP) for the transition state theory-inspired equation (TSTiEq) parameters calculation and verification using the most comprehensive DESs viscosity data set to date. For the energy parameters of the TSTiEq, the constant assumption and the fast iteration with the help of MLP can allow TSTiNet to achieve the best performance (the average absolute relative deviation on the test set of 6.84% and <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> of 0.9805). Compared with the traditional machine learning methods, the TSTiNet has better generalization ability and dramatically reduces the maximum relative deviation of prediction under the constraints of the thermodynamic formulation. It requires only the structural information on DESs and is the most accurate and reliable model available for DESs viscosity prediction.	2022	Transition State Theory-Inspired Neural Network for Estimating the Viscosity of Deep Eutectic Solvents.	35912349	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

One of the main advantages of DESs is that they are tailor-made solvents, and therefore, the number of potential DESs is extremely large. It is essential to have computational methods capable of predicting the physicochemical properties of DESs, which are needed in many industrial applications and research. Surface tension is one of the most important properties required in many applications. In this work, we report a relatively generalized artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the surface tension of DESs. The database used can be considered comprehensive because it contains 1571 data points from 133 different DES mixtures in 520 compositions prepared from 18 ions and 63 hydrogen bond donors in a temperature range of 277-425 K. The ANN model uses molecular parameter inputs derived from the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (<i>S</i> <sub>σ-profiles</sub>). The training and testing results show that the best performing ANN architecture consisted of two hidden layers with 15 neurons each (9-15-15-1). The proposed ANN was excellent in predicting the surface tension of DESs, as <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> values of 0.986 and 0.977 were obtained for training and testing, respectively, with an overall average absolute relative deviation of 2.20%.

The CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rate of various algal strains was collected and the cultivation conditions of the microalgae such as temperature, pH, CO<sub>2</sub> %, and amount of nitrogen and phosphorous (mg/L) were taken as the input variables, while the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rate was taken as the output variable. The optimization of ANFIS parameters and the formation of the optimized fuzzy model structure were performed by genetic algorithm (GA) using MATLAB in order to achieve optimum prediction capability and industrial applicability. The best-fitting model was figured out using statistical analysis parameters such as root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of regression (R<sup>2</sup>), and average absolute relative deviation (AARD). According to the analysis, GA-ANFIS model depicted a greater prediction capability over ANFIS model. The RMSE, R<sup>2</sup>, and AARD for GA-ANFIS were observed to be 0.000431, 0.97865, and 0.044354 in the training phase and 0.00056, 0.98457, and 0.032156 in the testing phase, respectively, for the GA-ANFIS Model.

In this observational study, demographic data, disease related features and comorbidities, COVID-19 manifestations and outcome as well as antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 were recorded among 77 consecutive patients with underlying AARD infected by SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of data was performed using univariate and multivariate models. Most patients (68.8%) had a mild COVID-19 course. The predominant clinical manifestations were fatigue (58.4%), low grade fever (45.4%) and upper respiratory tract symptoms (68.8%). About a quarter of patients required hospitalization (23.3%) and the mortality rate was 1.3%. Regarding COVID-19 severity, prior treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil or rituximab was more common in patients who developed a more serious disease course (60.0 vs 29.9%, p = 0.003, 40.0 vs 7.5%, p = 0.003, 10.0 vs 0.0%, p = 0.009, respectively). When disease related features and comorbidities were considered in multivariate models, older age and lung disease in the context of the AARD were found to be independent predictive factors for hospitalization (OR [95%]: 1.09 [1.03-1.15] and 6.43 [1.11-37.19]).

NA	10.1039/d1cp02033a	Among the different thermophysical properties of significant importance in the study of transport phenomena, viscosity has long defied attempts at presenting a unified model applicable to both pure compounds and binary mixtures within extended temperature and composition ranges. Similar to the role that ln(<i>P</i><sup>sat.</sup>)-<i>T</i><sup>-1</sup> profiles play in linearizing vapor pressure data, here it is contended for the first time that it is highly beneficial to study viscosity in the space, as opposed to the commonly used logarithmic space. Within this framework, the groundbreaking Lewis-Squires model is modified and extended to mixtures by studying 184 binary systems with 89 distinct ILs and 17 polar and nonpolar solutes. The dataset covers a total of 1104 isotherms with 10 909 data points, having quite an extensive range of viscosities, from 0.447 to 113 733 (mPa s). Breaking a highly regarded convention upheld for decades, the proposed model does not stipulate the availability of pure state viscosity and/or volumetric data over the whole temperature range, which acts as a bottleneck for the current literature models that have all been cast in the same mold inspired by thermodynamic mixing rules. In practice, without utilizing any volumetric properties, a single pure solvent viscosity datum at any reference temperature is the only requirement in the interpolative mode, which is complemented by the binary viscosity data at the reference isotherm of choice in the extrapolative mode of the proposed model that is concurrently applicable to both pure components and binary mixtures. An AARD of 2.82% was obtained in estimating the binary viscosity data using the new algorithm, while deviations of 13.58%, 6.79%, 6.17%, and 3.41% were obtained for the Grunberg and Nissan, Fang and He, Jouyban-Acree, and Eyring-MTSM models, respectively. Moreover, for extrapolation of the binary data measured at room temperature, a capability exclusive to the proposed model, an overall AARD of 5.66% was obtained for the mixtures of interest. With significant inherent flexibility, the new methodology could also be employed to represent the uncommon composition dependence of certain IL systems exhibiting multiple local extrema, with AARDs close to half of those of the current models.	2021	A global transform for the general formulation of liquid viscosities with significant linearizing benefits: a case study on ionic liquid mixtures.	34590662	AARD	C8orf85	primary_symbol

We evaluated their clinical performance in comparison with the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA) and analyzed samples with discrepant results.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 406 serum samples (206 from patients undergoing routine checkups and 200 from rheumatology clinic patients) were assayed using EliA, QUANTA Flash, and IIFA. We evaluated assay concordance and agreement and confirmed the presence of anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) antibodies in samples with discrepant automated immunoassay and IIFA results. Additionally, we compared the clinical performance of each assay in diagnosing ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD) and adjusted the cut-off values.<h4>Results</h4>In rheumatology clinic samples, the concordance and agreement were 91.5% and strong between EliA and QUANTA Flash, 79.0% and weak between EliA and IIFA, and 80.5% and moderate between QUANTA Flash and IIFA, respectively. In automated immunoassay-positive, IIFA-negative samples (N=15), all anti-ENA antibodies detected (6/15) were anti-Sjögren's syndrome antigen A/Ro (Ro60) antibodies. The automated immunoassays and IIFA showed high accuracy for diagnosing AARD, and adjusted cut-off values improved their sensitivities (EliA with 0.56 ratio, 82.9% sensitivity; QUANTA Flash with 9.7 chemiluminescent units, 87.8% sensitivity).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The two automated immunoassays showed reliable performance compared with IIFA and can be efficiently used with the IIFA in clinical immunology laboratories.

PMC8006465	10.3389/fnagi.2021.639428	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by specific alterations of brain DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns. Age and sex, two major risk factors for AD, are also known to largely affect the epigenetic profiles in brain, but their contribution to AD-associated DNAm changes has been poorly investigated. In this study we considered publicly available DNAm datasets of four brain regions (temporal, frontal, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum) from healthy adult subjects and AD patients, and performed a meta-analysis to identify sex-, age-, and AD-associated epigenetic profiles. In one of these datasets it was also possible to distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) profiles. We showed that DNAm differences between males and females tend to be shared between the four brain regions, while aging differently affects cortical regions compared to cerebellum. We found that the proportion of sex-dependent probes whose methylation is modified also during aging is higher than expected, but that differences between males and females tend to be maintained, with only a few probes showing age-by-sex interaction. We did not find significant overlaps between AD- and sex-associated probes, nor disease-by-sex interaction effects. On the contrary, we found that AD-related epigenetic modifications are significantly enriched in probes whose DNAm varies with age and that there is a high concordance between the direction of changes (hyper or hypo-methylation) in aging and AD, supporting accelerated epigenetic aging in the disease. In summary, our results suggest that age-associated DNAm patterns concur to the epigenetic deregulation observed in AD, providing new insights on how advanced age enables neurodegeneration.	2021	A Meta-Analysis of Brain DNA Methylation Across Sex, Age, and Alzheimer's Disease Points for Accelerated Epigenetic Aging in Neurodegeneration.	33790779	NCRNA00181	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC4640166	10.1186/s12864-015-2034-y	<h4>Background</h4>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark that can potentially link early life exposures to adverse health outcomes later in life. Host factors like sex and age strongly influence biological variation of DNA methylation, but characterization of these relationships is still limited, particularly in young children.<h4>Methods</h4>In a sample of 111 Mexican-American subjects (58 girls , 53 boys), we interrogated DNA methylation differences by sex at birth using the 450 K BeadChip in umbilical cord blood specimens, adjusting for cell composition.<h4>Results</h4>We observed that ~3% of CpG sites were differentially methylated between girls and boys at birth (FDR P < 0.05). Of those CpGs, 3031 were located on autosomes, and 82.8% of those were hypermethylated in girls compared to boys. Beyond individual CpGs, we found 3604 sex-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) where the majority (75.8%) had higher methylation in girls. Using pathway analysis, we found that sex-associated autosomal CpGs were significantly enriched for gene ontology terms related to nervous system development and behavior. Among hits in our study, 35.9% had been previously reported as sex-associated CpG sites in other published human studies. Further, for replicated hits, the direction of the association with methylation was highly concordant (98.5-100%) with previous studies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To our knowledge, this is the first reported epigenome-wide analysis by sex at birth that examined DMRs and adjusted for confounding by cell composition. We confirmed previously reported trends that methylation profiles are sex-specific even in autosomal genes, and also identified novel sex-associated CpGs in our methylome-wide analysis immediately after birth, a critical yet relatively unstudied developmental window.	2015	Sex differences in DNA methylation assessed by 450 K BeadChip in newborns.	26553366	NCRNA00181	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
NA	10.1002/lary.30840	<h4>Objective</h4>Biological data on the beneficial effects of vocal fold rehydration are lacking. This study aimed to examine the effects of acute systemic dehydration on vocal fold gene expression and determine whether rehydration would reverse these changes.<h4>Methods</h4>Male New Zealand White rabbits (N = 24, n = 8/group) provided the animal model. Systemic dehydration was induced by 5 days of water volume restriction. Rehydration was provided by ad-lib water for 3 days following dehydration. Euhydrated rabbits were used as the control group. Vocal fold tissue was dissected. Seventeen genes were selected based on physiological function and role in supporting vocal fold structure, oxidative stress, hemodynamics, and extracellular matrix turnover. Relative gene expression was assessed by RT-qPCR.<h4>Results</h4>Rehydration following systemic dehydration can modulate gene expression, with expression patterns suggesting that rehydration reverses dehydration-induced changes in over half of the tested genes. CLIC5 (chloride intracellular channel 5) and EFEMP1 (EGF containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1) genes were significantly upregulated in the dehydration group compared with the euhydrated control. A1BG (alpha-1B-glycoprotein) and IL1RAP (interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein) were downregulated by rehydration compared with the dehydration group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study provides molecular evidence for a transcriptional response to rehydration following acute systemic dehydration in the vocal folds. These data are the first to study gene expression following realistic dehydration and rehydration paradigms and provide biological data to support clinical recommendations to increase water intake after acute dehydration.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>N/A Laryngoscope, 2023.	2023	Impact of Rehydration Following Systemic Dehydration on Vocal Fold Gene Expression.	37345579	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC10093134	10.3390/diagnostics13071318	Nowadays, in the case of suspected prostate cancer (PCa), tissue needle biopsy remains the benchmark for diagnosis despite its invasiveness and poor tolerability, as serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is limited by low specificity. The aim of this proteomic study was to identify new diagnostic biomarkers in urine, an easily and non-invasively available sample, able to selectively discriminate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), evaluating whether the presence of inflammation may be a confounding parameter. The analysis was performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) on urine samples from PCa and BPH patients, divided into subgroups based on the presence or absence of inflammation. Significant quantitative and qualitative differences were found in the urinary proteomic profile of PCa and BPH groups. Of the nine differentially expressed proteins, only five can properly be considered potential biomarkers of PCa able to discriminate the two diseases, as they were not affected by the inflammatory process. Therefore, the proteomic research of novel and reliable urinary biomarkers of PCa should be conducted considering the presence of inflammation as a realistic interfering element, as it could hinder the detection of important protein targets.	2023	Research of Prostate Cancer Urinary Diagnostic Biomarkers by Proteomics: The Noteworthy Influence of Inflammation.	37046536	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9977555	10.1155/2023/6072438	<h4>Introduction</h4>Diabetes is a chronic inflammatory state, and a key role of lncRNAs in diabetes complications is a new area of research.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, key lncRNAs related to diabetes inflammation were identified by RNA-chip mining and lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network construction and finally verified by RT-qPCR.<h4>Results</h4>We ultimately obtained 12 genes, including A1BG-AS1, AC084125.4, RAMP2-AS1, FTX, DBH-AS1, LOXL1-AS1, LINC00893, LINC00894, PVT1, RUSC1-AS1, HCG25, and ATP1B3-AS1. RT-qPCR assays verified that LOXL1-AS1, A1BG-AS1, FTX, PVT1, and HCG25 were upregulated in the HG+LPS-induced THP-1 cells, and LINC00893, LINC00894, RUSC1-AS1, DBH-AS1, and RAMP2-AS1 were downregulated in the HG+LPS-induced THP-1 cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>lncRNAs and mRNAs are extensively linked and form a coexpression network, and lncRNAs may influence the development of type 2 diabetes by regulating the corresponding mRNAs. The ten key genes obtained may become biomarkers of inflammation in type 2 diabetes in the future.	2023	Bioinformatics Analysis of the Inflammation-Associated lncRNA-mRNA Coexpression Network in Type 2 Diabetes.	36874406	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC10007776	10.1186/s13098-023-01007-y	<h4>Background</h4>Subclinical atherosclerosis is frequently observed in type 1 diabetes (T1D) although the mechanisms and markers involved in the evolution to established cardiovascular disease are not well known. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol in T1D is normal or even high, and changes in its functionality and proteomics are considered. Our aim was to evaluate the proteomics of HDL subfractions in T1D and control subjects and its association with clinical variables, subclinical atherosclerosis markers and HDL functionality.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 50 individuals with T1D and 30 matched controls were included. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), and ten-year cardiovascular risk (ASCVDR) were determined. Proteomics (parallel reaction monitoring) was determined in isolated HDL<sub>2</sub> and HDL<sub>3</sub> that were also utilized to measure cholesterol efflux from macrophages.<h4>Results</h4>Among 45 quantified proteins, 13 in HDL<sub>2</sub> and 33 in HDL<sub>3</sub> were differentially expressed in T1D and control subjects. Six proteins related to lipid metabolism, one to inflammatory acute phase, one to complement system and one to antioxidant response were more abundant in HDL<sub>2</sub>, while 14 lipid metabolism, three acute-phase, three antioxidants and one transport in HDL<sub>3</sub> of T1D subjects. Three proteins (lipid metabolism, transport, and unknown function) were more abundant in HDL<sub>2</sub>; and ten (lipid metabolism, transport, protease inhibition), more abundant in HDL<sub>3</sub> of controls. Individuals with T1D had higher PWV and ten-year ASCVDR, and lower FMD, Cholesterol efflux from macrophages was similar between T1D and controls. Proteins in HDL<sub>2</sub> and HDL<sub>3</sub>, especially related to lipid metabolism, correlated with PWV, CAN, cholesterol efflux, HDLc, hypertension, glycemic control, ten-year ASCVDR, and statins use.<h4>Conclusion</h4>HDL proteomics can be predictive of subclinical atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes. Proteins that are not involved in reverse cholesterol transport may be associated with the protective role of HDL.	2023	Proteomics of high-density lipoprotein subfractions and subclinical atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes mellitus: a case-control study.	36899434	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC10117404	10.1158/2767-9764.crc-23-0015	The response rates upon neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in stage III melanoma are higher as compared with stage IV disease. Given that successful ICB depends on systemic immune response, we hypothesized that systemic immune suppression might be a mechanism responsible for lower response rates in late-stage disease, and also potentially with disease recurrence in early-stage disease. Plasma and serum samples of cohorts of patients with melanoma were analyzed for circulating proteins using mass spectrometry proteomic profiling and Olink proteomic assay. A cohort of paired samples of patients with stage III that progressed to stage IV disease (<i>n</i> = 64) was used to identify markers associated with higher tumor burden. Baseline patient samples from the OpACIN-neo study (<i>n</i> = 83) and PRADO study (<i>n</i> = 49; NCT02977052) were used as two independent cohorts to analyze whether the potential identified markers are also associated with disease recurrence after neoadjuvant ICB therapy. When comparing baseline proteins overlapping between patients with progressive disease and patients with recurrent disease, we found leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) to be associated with worse prognosis. Especially nonresponder patients to neoadjuvant ICB (OpACIN-neo) with high LRG1 expression had a poor outcome with an estimated 36-month event-free survival of 14% as compared with 83% for nonresponders with a low LRG1 expression (<i>P</i> = 0.014). This finding was validated in an independent cohort (<i>P</i> = 0.0021). LRG1 can be used as a biomarker to identify patients with high risk for disease progression and recurrence, and might be a target to be combined with neoadjuvant ICB.<h4>Significance</h4>LRG1 could serve as a potential target and as a biomarker to identify patients with high risk for disease recurrence, and consequently benefit from additional therapies and intensive follow-up.	2023	Systemic LRG1 Expression in Melanoma is Associated with Disease Progression and Recurrence.	37089863	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC10008006	10.2147/dmso.s396239	<h4>Purpose</h4>Obesity is considered a promoter of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to identify plasma exosome differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that are potentially involved in the development of obesity-related T2DM.<h4>Methods</h4>Exosomes were isolated from the plasma of obese and non-obese T2DM patients (n = 10 for each group). A label-free quantitative mass spectrometry analysis was applied to identify plasma exosome DEPs in obese patients compared with non-obese patients, followed by bioinformatics analysis including GO annotation, KEGG analysis, subcellular localization prediction, transcription factor analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 2 significantly upregulated proteins (C9 and PON1) and 5 significantly downregulated proteins (HPX, A1BG, CFHR1, ANG, and CALM) in obese patients compared with those in non-obese patients. KEGG analysis demonstrated that the insulin signaling pathway was one of the pathways that significantly correlated with the DEPs. The DEPs were primarily localized in the extracellular space (5 out of 7). HMG-box and NF-Y beta might regulate the transcription of the DEPs. C9, PON1, HPX, and CFHR1 were present in the PPI network.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The plasma exosome DEPs are potentially responsible for the development of obesity-related T2DM possibly through the insulin signaling pathway and the interaction with other proteins. Our study may guide future research direction toward the pathogenesis of obesity-related T2DM.	2023	Comparison of Plasma Exosome Proteomes Between Obese and Non-Obese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.	36915396	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Results  We finally obtained 12 genes, including A1BG-AS1, AC084125.4, RAMP2-AS1, FTX, DBH-AS1, LOXL1-AS1, LINC00893, LINC00894, PVT1, RUSC1-AS1, HCG25, and ATP1B3-AS1. RT-qPCR verified that A1BG-AS1, HCG25, and LOXL1-AS1 were upregulated in the HG + LPS-induced THP-1 cell model, and DBH-AS1 was downregulated in the HG + LPS-induced THP-1 cell model. Conclusions  LncRNAs and mRNAs are extensively linked and form a co-expression network, and lncRNAs may influence the development of type 2 diabetes by regulating the corresponding mRNAs.

PMC9924781	10.19852/j.cnki.jtcm.20220617.002	<h4>Objective</h4>To explore the novel biomarkers and therapeutic target candidates related to the stasis-heat syndrome of acute intracerebral hemorrhage (AICH).<h4>Methods</h4>Applying an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation-(iTRAQ-) based quantitative proteomic approach, plasma samples from AICH patients with stasis-heat, and AICH patients with non-stasis-heat and healthy control subjects were collected and analyzed to distinguish differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) correlated to AICH with stasis-heat in this block design. The standard Western blot was applied to verify DEPs. Additionally, DEPs were analyzed via bioinformatic platforms and further approved via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 26 DEPs were found among AICH with the stasis-heat, AICH with non-stasis-heat, and healthy control group. The seven DEPs compared with the non-stasis-heat group are closely related to the pathogenesis of stasis heat. These proteins showed three different protein expression patterns. The alpha-1-b glycoprotein (A1BG) and copper-protein (CP) were up-regulated in the stasis-heat group, but down-regulated in the non-stasis-heat group. Compared with the non-stasis-heat group, the expression abundance of actinin, alpha 1 (ACTN1), carbonic anhydrase I (CA1), peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), and vinculin (VCL) is higher in the stasis-heat group, while the CD44 is the opposite. These differences reflect that stasis-heat syndrome has more severe inflammatory immune response, coagulation disorders and damage. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that a wide variety of cellular and metabolic processes and some signaling pathways were involved in the pathophysiology of AICH with stasis-heat. AICH with stasis-heat syndrome showed more severe inflammatory reactions, tissue damage, and coagulation disorders than non-stasis heat syndrome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There are differences in the protein expression patterns between the stasis-heat syndrome and non-stasis-heat syndrome. These differences reflect that stasis-heat syndrome has more severe damage. CD44, CP, ACTN1, CA1, VCL, PRDX2, and A1BG could be the potential biomarkers and therapeutic target candidates of the stasis-heat subtype.

PMC9162367	10.1371/journal.pone.0267744	Immunoglobulin superfamily, member 1 (IGSF1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein with high expression in the mammalian pituitary gland. Mutations in the IGSF1 gene cause congenital central hypothyroidism in humans. The IGSF1 protein is co-translationally cleaved into N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD), the latter of which is trafficked to the plasma membrane and appears to be the functional portion of the molecule. Though the IGSF1-NTD is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and has no apparent function, it has a high degree of sequence identity with the IGSF1-CTD and is conserved across mammalian species. Based upon phylogenetic analyses, we propose that the ancestral IGSF1 gene encoded the IGSF1-CTD, which was duplicated and integrated immediately upstream of itself, yielding a larger protein encompassing the IGSF1-NTD and IGSF1-CTD. The selective pressures favoring the initial gene duplication and subsequent retention of a conserved IGSF1-NTD are unresolved.	2022	The extant immunoglobulin superfamily, member 1 gene results from an ancestral gene duplication in eutherian mammals.	35653309	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
NA	10.3390/cells12121601	The development of new approaches allowing for the early assessment of COVID-19 cases that are likely to become critical and the discovery of new therapeutic targets are urgently required. In this prospective cohort study, we performed proteomic and laboratory profiling of plasma from 163 COVID-19 patients admitted to Bauru State Hospital (Brazil) between 4 May 2020 and 4 July 2020. Plasma samples were collected upon admission for routine laboratory analyses and shotgun quantitative label-free proteomics. Based on the course of the disease, the patients were divided into three groups: (a) mild (<i>n</i> = 76) and (b) severe (<i>n</i> = 56) symptoms, whose patients were discharged without or with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), respectively, and (c) critical (<i>n</i> = 31), a group consisting of patients who died after admission to an ICU. Based on our data, potential therapies for COVID-19 should target proteins involved in inflammation, the immune response and complement system, and blood coagulation. Other proteins that could potentially be employed in therapies against COVID-19 but that so far have not been associated with the disease are CD5L, VDBP, A1BG, C4BPA, PGLYRP2, SERPINC1, and APOH. Targeting these proteins' pathways might constitute potential new therapies or biomarkers of prognosis of the disease.	2023	Analysis of Plasma Proteins Involved in Inflammation, Immune Response/Complement System, and Blood Coagulation upon Admission of COVID-19 Patients to Hospital May Help to Predict the Prognosis of the Disease.	37371071	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9301696	10.1021/acsomega.2c00837	This study aimed to identify secreted protein biomarkers in serum from the label-free LC/MS proteomics of neutrophils in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients for the diagnosis biomarkers of TB label-free LC/MS. The proteomic profiles of neutrophils from 15 active TB patients and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed using label-free LC/MS. We identified 358 differentially expressed proteins preliminarily, including 279 up-regulated proteins and 79 down-regulated proteins. Thirty-eight differentially expressed secreted proteins involved in the progress of platelet degranulation between TB patients and HCs were focused. Of these, serotransferrin (TRF), alpha-2-macroglobulin (AMG), alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (AAG), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 2 (AGP2), and alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG) were selected for further verification in the serum of additional 134 TB patients and 138 HCs by nephelometry and ELISA in the training set. Statistically significant differences of TRF (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), AAT (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), AAG (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), AGP2 (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and A1BG (<i>P</i> = 0.0003) were observed. The serum concentration of TRF was down-regulated in TB patients compared with healthy controls, which was coincident with the proteomics results. An additional validation of TRF was performed in an independent cohort of patients with active TB (<i>n</i> = 46), patients with lung cancer (<i>n</i> = 37), 20 HCs, and patients with pneumonia (<i>n</i> = 35) in the test set by nephelometry. The serum expression levels of TRF in the TB patients showed lower levels compared with those in patients with pneumonia (<i>P</i> = 0.0125), lung cancer (<i>P</i> = 0.0005), HCs (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and the non-TB controls (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). Furthermore, the AUC value of TRF was 0.647 with 90.22% sensitivity and 42.86% specificity in discriminating the TB group from the pneumonia group, 0.702 with 93.48% sensitivity and 47.16% specificity in discriminating the TB group from the lung cancer group, 0.894 with 91.30% sensitivity and 71.62% specificity in discriminating the TB group from all HCs, and 0.792 with 91.30% sensitivity and 58.90% specificity in discriminating the TB group from the non-TB controls. This study obtained the proteomic profiles of neutrophils in the TB patients and HCs, which contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis molecules existing in the neutrophils of pulmonary tuberculosis and provide candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.	2022	Validation of Serotransferrin in the Serum as Candidate Biomarkers for the Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis by Label-Free LC/MS.	35874208	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9698074	10.3390/ijms232213700	Meningitis due to <i>Streptococcus suis</i> causes high mortality and morbidity on pig farms and has increasing zoonotic potential worldwide. Saliva proteome analysis would potentially be useful in elucidating pathophysiological changes and mining for new biomarkers to diagnose and monitor <i>S. suis</i> infection. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in the salivary and serum proteome profile of piglets with meningitis. The LC-MS/MS TMT proteomic approach was used to analyze saliva and serum samples from 20 male piglets: 10 with meningitis and 10 healthy. In saliva, 11 proteins had higher and 10 had lower relative abundance in piglets with meningitis. The proteins with the highest relative abundance were metavinculin (VCL) and desmocollin-2 (DSC2). Adenosine deaminase (ADA) was selected for validation using a spectrophotometric assay and demonstrated excellent performance in the differentiation between healthy and pigs with meningitis due to <i>S. suis</i>. In serum, the most protruding changes occurred for one SERPIN and haptoglobin (HP). In saliva and serum, the highest number of proteins with altered abundance were linked, via the enrichment analysis, with platelet and neutrophil pathways. Overall, meningitis caused by <i>S. suis</i> resulted in specific proteome changes in saliva and serum, reflecting different pathophysiological mechanisms, and marking new potential biomarkers for this infection.	2022	Revealing the Changes in Saliva and Serum Proteins of Pigs with Meningitis Caused by Streptococcus Suis: A Proteomic Approach.	36430174	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

PMC9760568	10.1016/j.envres.2022.114828	<h4>Background</h4>DNA methylation programming is sensitive to prenatal life environmental influences, but the impact of maternal exposure to green space on newborns DNA methylation has not been studied yet.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a meta-epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of maternal exposure to green space during gestation with cord blood DNA methylation in two subsets of the ENVIRONAGE cohort (N = 538). Cord blood DNA methylation was measured by Illumina HumanMethylation 450K in one subset (N = 189) and EPICarray in another (N = 349). High (vegetation height>3 m (m)), low (vegetation height<3 m) and total (including both) high-resolution green space exposures during pregnancy were estimated within 100 m and 1000 m distance around maternal residence. In each subset, we sought cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites via linear mixed models adjusted on newborns' sex, ethnicity, gestational age, season at delivery, sampling day, maternal parity, age, smoking, education, and estimated blood cell proportions. EWASs results were meta-analysed via fixed-effects meta-analyses. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified via ENmix-combp and DMRcate algorithms. Sensitivity analyses were additionally adjusted on PM<sub>2.5</sub>, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income. In the 450K subset, cord blood expression of differentially methylated genes was measured by Agilent microarrays and associated with green space.<h4>Results</h4>147 DMRs were identified, 85 of which were still significant upon adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, distance to major roads, urbanicity and neighborhood income, including HLA-DRB5, RPTOR, KCNQ1DN, A1BG-AS1, HTR2A, ZNF274, COL11A1 and PRSS36 DMRs. One CpG reached genome-wide significance, while 54 CpGs were suggestive significant (p-values<1e-05). Among them, a CpG, hypermethylated with 100 m buffer total green space, was annotated to PAQR9, whose expression decreased with 1000 m buffer low green space (p-value = 1.45e-05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results demonstrate that maternal exposure to green space during pregnancy is associated with cord blood DNA methylation, mainly at loci organized in regions, in genes playing important roles in neurological development (e.g., HTR2A).	2023	Epigenome-wide analysis of maternal exposure to green space during gestation and cord blood DNA methylation in the ENVIRONAGE cohort.	36400229	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9290207	10.1016/j.devcel.2021.09.022	Sex disparities in cardiac homeostasis and heart disease are well documented, with differences attributed to actions of sex hormones. However, studies have indicated sex chromosomes act outside of the gonads to function without mediation by gonadal hormones. Here, we performed transcriptional and proteomics profiling to define differences between male and female mouse hearts. We demonstrate, contrary to current dogma, cardiac sex disparities are controlled not only by sex hormones but also through a sex-chromosome mechanism. Using Turner syndrome (XO) and Klinefelter (XXY) models, we find the sex-chromosome pathway is established by X-linked gene dosage. We demonstrate cardiac sex disparities occur at the earliest stages of heart formation, a period before gonad formation. Using these datasets, we identify and define a role for alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG), showing loss of A1BG leads to cardiac defects in females, but not males. These studies provide resources for studying sex-biased cardiac disease states.	2021	Cardiac proteomics reveals sex chromosome-dependent differences between males and females that arise prior to gonad formation.	34655525	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC8657005	10.3390/cancers13235901	New insights into the underlying biological processes of breast cancer are needed for the development of improved markers and treatments. The complex nature of mammary cancer in dogs makes it a great model to study cancer biology since they present a high degree of tumor heterogeneity. In search of disease-state biomarkers candidates, we applied proteomic mass spectrometry imaging in order to simultaneously detect histopathological and molecular alterations whilst preserving morphological integrity, comparing peptide expression between intratumor populations in distinct levels of differentiation. Peptides assigned to FNDC1, A1BG, and double-matching keratins 18 and 19 presented a higher intensity in poorly differentiated regions. In contrast, we observed a lower intensity of peptides matching calnexin, PDIA3, and HSPA5 in poorly differentiated cells, which enriched for protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and antigen processing, assembly, and loading of class I MHC. Over-representation of collagen metabolism, coagulation cascade, extracellular matrix components, cadherin-binding and cell adhesion pathways also distinguished cell populations. Finally, an independent validation showed FNDC1, A1BG, PDIA3, HSPA5, and calnexin as significant prognostic markers for human breast cancer patients.

Thirty Holstein calves infected with only Cryptosporidium spp. were divided into three equal groups. Calves in the PC group received paromomycin orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg once daily for 5 days. Calves in PCOL and PBCOL groups received 250 ml colostrum 3 h after feeding twice a day for 3 days. The PBCOL group was also given 6 g of sodium bicarbonate 15 min before colostrum administration. While the fecal scores of all calves were evaluated daily for 10 days from the initiation of the treatment, fecal oocyst counts were determined on the 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10th days. Brix%, total protein (TP), immunoglobulin G (IgG), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels, and proteomic analyses were performed on the 0 and 3rd days' sera. Considering pretreatment values, fecal scores (8th, 2nd, and 2nd day), and fecal oocyst counts (10th, 3rd, and 2nd day) improved in a significantly (p < 0.05) shorter time in the colostrum groups than in the control group. By serum proteomic analysis, 99, 93, and 83 proteomes were detected in PC, PCOL, and PBCOL groups, respectively. Although the significant changes in any protein in Group PC were absent, significant changes were observed in Alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG), Zinc transporterZIP11 (S39AB), Cathelicidin-1 (CTHL1), Actin_ cytoplasmic-1 (ACTB), and Apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4) proteins in Group PCOL and Alpha-1-antiproteinase (A1AT), Serum amyloid A protein (SAA), Actin-cytoplasmic-2 (ACTG), Protein HP-20 homolog (HP20) proteins in Group PBCOL with colostral treatment, which indicated that the use of colostrum had an effect on calf serum proteomes. The more pronounced healing and shorter clinical improvement time in the colostrum groups especially colostrum with sodium bicarbonate revealed that these proteomes have positive effects in the treatment with their systemic and local effects in the intestines.	2022	Evaluation of the efficacy of cow colostrum in the treatment and its effect on serum proteomes in calves with cryptosporidiosis.	35500421	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
NA	10.1007/s13577-021-00554-8	The dysregulated long non-coding RNA A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) has been implicated in the oncogenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction in this study, we detected A1BG-AS1 expression in breast cancer and elucidated the regulatory functions and exact mechanisms of A1BG-AS1 in breast cancer cells. The regulatory functions of A1BG-AS1 were examined in vitro using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometric, and Transwell migration and invasion assays and in vivo through tumor xenograft experiments. In addition, we performed bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments to verify the interaction among A1BG-AS1, microRNA-485-5p (miR-485-5p), and flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in breast cancer. We found A1BG-AS1 to be highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. In terms of function, depleted A1BG-AS1 markedly suppressed cell proliferation, accelerated cell apoptosis, and hindered cell migration and invasion in breast cancer. Furthermore, A1BG-AS1 interference reduced tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations confirmed that A1BG-AS1 directly interacted with miR-485-5p as a molecular sponge. We demonstrated that FLOT1 is a direct target of miR-485-5p, which could be positively regulated by A1BG-AS1 by competing for miR-485-5p. Rescue experiments clearly showed that the downregulation of miR-485-5p and upregulation of FLOT1 were capable of reversing the anticancer activities of A1BG-AS1 deficiency in terms of breast cancer cell malignancy. A1BG-AS1 acts as a miR-485-5p sponge and subsequently increases FLOT1 expression in breast cancer cells, ultimately facilitating cancer progression. Hence, the A1BG-AS1/miR-485-5p/FLOT1 pathway might offer a novel therapeutic perspective for breast cancer.	2021	Long non-coding RNA A1BG-AS1 promotes tumorigenesis in breast cancer by sponging microRNA-485-5p and consequently increasing expression of FLOT1 expression.	34115333	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC10209167	10.1038/s41598-023-35597-4	Most biomedical knowledge is published as text, making it challenging to analyse using traditional statistical methods. In contrast, machine-interpretable data primarily comes from structured property databases, which represent only a fraction of the knowledge present in the biomedical literature. Crucial insights and inferences can be drawn from these publications by the scientific community. We trained language models on literature from different time periods to evaluate their ranking of prospective gene-disease associations and protein-protein interactions. Using 28 distinct historical text corpora of abstracts published between 1995 and 2022, we trained independent Word2Vec models to prioritise associations that were likely to be reported in future years. This study demonstrates that biomedical knowledge can be encoded as word embeddings without the need for human labelling or supervision. Language models effectively capture drug discovery concepts such as clinical tractability, disease associations, and biochemical pathways. Additionally, these models can prioritise hypotheses years before their initial reporting. Our findings underscore the potential for extracting yet-to-be-discovered relationships through data-driven approaches, leading to generalised biomedical literature mining for potential therapeutic drug targets. The Publication-Wide Association Study (PWAS) enables the prioritisation of under-explored targets and provides a scalable system for accelerating early-stage target ranking, irrespective of the specific disease of interest.	2023	A publication-wide association study (PWAS), historical language models to prioritise novel therapeutic drug targets.	37225853	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9270879	10.7717/peerj.13693	<h4>Background</h4><i>Tecoma stans</i> (L.) Juss. ex Kunth is a well-known medicinal plant found in tropical and subtropical regions. It contains a broad range of bioactive compounds that exhibit many biological effects, including antidiabetic, antibacterial, and antioxidative activities. However, the effect of natural peptides from <i>T. stans</i> against cancer progression and free radical production is unknown. This study aims to evaluate the cytotoxic, anti-metastatic, and antioxidative activities of natural peptides from <i>T. stans</i> on A549 cells.<h4>Methods</h4>The natural peptides were extracted from the flower of <i>T. stans</i> using the pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) method, followed by size exclusion chromatography and solid-phase extraction-C18. The cytotoxic and anti-metastatic effects of natural peptides were evaluated using MTT and transwell chamber assays, respectively. The free radical scavenging activity of natural peptides was determined using ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays. The cells were pretreated with the IC<sub>50</sub> dosage of natural peptides and stimulated with LPS before analyzing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteomics.<h4>Results</h4>Natural peptides induced cell toxicity at a concentration of less than 1 ng/ml and markedly reduced cell motility of A549 cells. The cells had a migration rate of less than 10% and lost their invasion ability in the treatment condition. In addition, natural peptides showed free radical scavenging activity similar to standard antioxidants and significantly decreased intracellular ROS in the LPS-induced cells. Proteomic analysis revealed 1,604 differentially expressed proteins. The self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) clustered the protein abundances into eleven groups. The volcano plot revealed that the cancer-promoting proteins (NCBP2, AMD, MER34, ENC1, and COA4) were down-regulated, while the secretory glycoprotein (A1BG) and ROS-reducing protein (ASB6) were up-regulated in the treatment group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic activities of natural peptides may be attributed to the suppression of several cancer-promoting proteins. In contrast, their antioxidative activity may result from the up-regulation of ROS-reducing protein. This finding suggests that natural peptides from <i>T. stans</i> are viable for being the new potential anti-cancer and antioxidative agents.	2022	Evaluation of potential anti-metastatic and antioxidative abilities of natural peptides derived from <i>Tecoma stans</i> (L.)

However, the relationship and interaction mechanism between lncRNAs and fatty acid signaling in HCC remain unclear. Data regarding RNA expression and clinical outcomes for patients with HCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), HCCDB, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Hallmark pathways were identified using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method. ConsensusClusterPlus was used to establish a consistency matrix for classifying samples into three subtypes. A risk signature was established, and predictive values for key lncRNAs related to prognosis were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. The ESTIMATE algorithm, MCP-Counter, and ssGSEA were used to evaluate the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment. The CTRP2.0 and PRISM were used to analyze drug sensitivity in HCC subtypes. We discovered seven fatty-acid-associated lncRNAs with predictive prognostic capabilities, including TRAF3IP2-AS1, SNHG10, AL157392.2, LINC02641, AL357079.1, AC046134.2, and A1BG-AS. Three subtypes were obtained, which presented with differences in prognosis, clinical information, mutation features, pathway traits, immune characteristics, and drug sensitivity. The seven key lncRNAs identified in this study might serve as promising biomarkers for predicting prognosis in patients with HCC, and the three HCC subtypes classified according to lncRNA expression profiles could improve HCC classification.	2022	A novel classification of HCC basing on fatty-acid-associated lncRNA.	36344648	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9966955	10.3390/ijms24044164	Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death for women in the United States, and early detection could offer patients the opportunity to receive early intervention. The current methods of diagnosis rely on mammograms and have relatively high rates of false positivity, causing anxiety in patients. We sought to identify protein markers in saliva and serum for early detection of breast cancer. A rigorous analysis was performed for individual saliva and serum samples from women without breast disease, and women diagnosed with benign or malignant breast disease, using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, and employing a random effects model. A total of 591 and 371 proteins were identified in saliva and serum samples from the same individuals, respectively. The differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in exocytosis, secretion, immune response, neutrophil-mediated immunity and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. Using a network biology approach, significantly expressed proteins in both biological fluids were evaluated for protein-protein interaction networks and further analyzed for these being potential biomarkers in breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Our systems approach illustrates a feasible platform for investigating the responsive proteomic profile in benign and malignant breast disease using saliva and serum from the same women.	2023	Potential Early Markers for Breast Cancer: A Proteomic Approach Comparing Saliva and Serum Samples in a Pilot Study.	36835577	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
NA	10.1007/s11033-021-06722-1	<h4>Background</h4>The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a most promising target for the development of anticancer drugs. Allicin (diallylthiosulfinate) is one of the most active components of garlic (Alliium sativum L.) and possesses a variety of health-promoting properties with pharmacological applications. However, whether allicin plays an anti-cancer role against breast cancer cells through the induction of p53-mediated apoptosis remains unknown.<h4>Methods and results</h4>In this study, we investigate the anti-breast cancer effect of allicin in vitro by using MCF-7 and MD-MBA-231 cells. We found that allicin reduces cell viability, induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in both cells. Allicin activated p53 and caspase 3 expressions in both cells but produced different effects on the expression of p53-related biomarkers. In MDA-MB-231 cells, allicin up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of A1BG and THBS1 while down-regulated the expression of TPM4. Conversely, the mRNA and protein expression of A1BG, THBS1 and TPM4 were all reduced in MCF-7 cells. Hence, allicin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells through p53 activation but it effects on the expression of p53-related biomarkers were dependent upon the specific type of breast cancer involved.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings suggest that allicin induces apoptosis and regulates biomarker expression in breast cancer cell lines through modulating the p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, our results promote the utility of allicin as compound for further studies as an anticancer drug targeting p53.	2021	Allicin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of breast cancer cells in vitro via modulating the p53 pathway.	34626309	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9101816	10.3390/ijms23094633	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine and metabolic disorder in reproductive-aged women, and it typically involves elevated androgen levels. Recently, it has been reported that human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) can regulate androgen synthesis pathways. However, the details of the mechanism are still unclear. hBM-MSC-derived secreted factors (the secretome) are promising sources of cell-based therapy as they consist of various types of proteins. It is thus important to know which proteins interact with disease-implicated biomolecules. This work aimed to investigate which secretome components contain the key factor that inhibits testosterone synthesis. In this study, we fractionated hBM-MSC-conditioned media into three fractions based on their molecular weights and found that, of the three fractions, one had the ability to inhibit the androgen-producing genes efficiently. We also analyzed the components of this fraction and established a protein profile of the hBM-MSC secretome, which was shown to inhibit androgen synthesis. Our study describes a set of protein components present in the hBM-MSC secretome that can be used therapeutically to treat PCOS by regulating androgen production for the first time.	2022	Non-Cytokine Protein Profile of the Mesenchymal Stem Cell Secretome That Regulates the Androgen Production Pathway.	35563028	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC10219446	10.3390/ijms24108953	In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), malignant cells modify the properties of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), reducing their ability to maintain normal hematopoiesis. The aim of this work was to elucidate the role of MSCs in supporting leukemia cells and the restoration of normal hematopoiesis by analyzing ex vivo MSC secretomes at the onset of AML and in remission. The study included MSCs obtained from the bone marrow of 13 AML patients and 21 healthy donors. The analysis of proteins contained in the MSCs-conditioned medium demonstrated that secretomes of patient MSCs differed little between the onset of AML and remission; pronounced differences were observed between MSC secretomes of AML patients and healthy donors. The onset of AML was accompanied by a decrease in the secretion of proteins related to ossification, transport, and immune response. In remission, but not at the onset, secretion of proteins responsible for cell adhesion, immune response, and complement was reduced compared to donors. We conclude that AML causes crucial and, to a large extent, irreversible changes in the secretome of bone marrow MSCs ex vivo. In remission, functions of MSCs remain impaired despite the absence of tumor cells and the formation of benign hematopoietic cells.	2023	Acute Myeloid Leukemia Causes Serious and Partially Irreversible Changes in Secretomes of Bone Marrow Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.	37240298	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by different levels of chronic low-grade inflammation and vascular dysfunction; however, there are few data characterizing the serum exosomal protein cargo of GDM patients and associated signaling pathways. Eighteen pregnant women were enrolled in the study: 8 controls (CG) and 10 patients with GDM. Blood samples were collected from patients, for exosomes' concentration. Protein abundance alterations were demonstrated by relative mass spectrometric analysis and their association with clinical parameters in GDM patients was performed using Pearson's correlation analysis. The proteomics analysis revealed 78 significantly altered proteins when comparing GDM to CG, related to complement and coagulation cascades, platelet activation, prothrombotic factors and cholesterol metabolism. Down-regulation of Complement C3 (C3), Complement C5 (C5), C4-B (C4B), C4b-binding protein beta chain (C4BPB) and C4b-binding protein alpha chain (C4BPA), and up-regulation of C7, C9 and F12 were found in GDM.

PMC10125028	10.1152/japplphysiol.00508.2022	Angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)] is an active heptapeptide of the noncanonical arm of the renin-angiotensin system that modulates molecular signaling pathways associated with vascular and cellular inflammation, vasoconstriction, and fibrosis. Preclinical evidence suggests that Ang (1-7) is a promising therapeutic target that may ameliorate physical and cognitive function in late life. However, treatment pharmacodynamics limits its clinical applicability. Therefore, this study explored the underlying mechanisms altered by a genetically modified probiotic (GMP) that expresses Ang (1-7) combined with and without exercise training in an aging male rat model as a potential adjunct strategy to exercise training to counteract the decline of physical and cognitive function. We evaluated cross-tissue (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, colon, liver, and skeletal muscle) multi-omics responses. After 12 wk of intervention, the 16S mRNA microbiome analysis revealed a main effect of probiotic treatment within- and between groups. The probiotic treatment enhanced α diversity (Inverse Simpson (<i>F</i>[2,56] = 4.44; <i>P</i> = 0.02); Shannon-Wiener (<i>F</i>[2,56] = 4.27; <i>P</i> = 0.02)) and β-diversity (<i>F</i>[2,56] = 2.66; <i>P</i> = 0.01) among rats receiving our GMP. The analysis of microbes' composition revealed three genera altered by our GMP (<i>Enterorhabdus</i>, <i>Muribaculaceae unclassified</i>, and <i>Faecalitalea</i>). The mRNA multi-tissue data analysis showed that our combined intervention upregulated neuroremodeling pathways on prefrontal cortex (i.e., 140 genes), inflammation gene expression in the liver (i.e., 63 genes), and circadian rhythm signaling on skeletal muscle. Finally, the integrative network analysis detected different communities of tightly (|<i>r</i>| > 0.8 and <i>P</i> < 0.05) correlated metabolites, <i>genera</i>, and genes in these tissues.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This manuscript uses a multiomics approach (i.e., microbiome, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) to explore the underlying mechanisms driven by a genetically modified probiotic (GMP) designed to express angiotensin (1-7) combined with moderate exercise training in an aged male rat model.

PMC10195163	10.1155/2023/5552798	<h4>Background</h4>Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is the most frequently seen type of primary liver cancer. Cuproptosis is a novel form of cell death highly associated with mitochondrial metabolism. However, the clinical impact and pertinent mechanism of cuproptosis genes in LIHC remain largely unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>From public databases, we systematically assessed common genes from LIHC differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and cuproptosis-related genes using bioinformatics analysis. These common genes were then analyzed by enrichment analysis, mutation analysis, risk score model, and others to find candidate hub genes related to LIHC and cuproptosis. Next, hub genes were determined by expression, clinical factors, immunoassay, and prognostic nomogram.<h4>Results</h4>Based on 129 cuproptosis-related genes and 3492 LIHC DEGs, we totally identified 21 downregulated and 18 upregulated common genes, and they were enriched in pathways, such as zinc ion homeostasis and oxidative phosphorylation. In the mutation analysis, missense mutation was the most common type in LIHC patients, and the common gene F5 had the highest mutation frequency. After LASSO-Cox regression analysis and prognostic analysis, CDK1, ABCB6, LCAT, and COA6 were identified as prognostic signature genes. Among them, ABCB6 and LCAT were lowly expressed in tumors, and CDK1 and COA6 were highly expressed in tumors. In addition, ABCB6 and LCAT were negatively correlated with 6 kinds of immune cells, while CDK1 and COA6 were positively correlated with them. CDK1 and COA6 were identified as hub genes related to LIHC by Cox regression analysis and prognostic nomogram.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CDK1 and COA6 are two oncogenes in LIHC, which are involved in the molecular mechanism of cuproptosis and LIHC. Besides, CDK1 and COA6 can positively regulate the expressions of immune cells in LIHC. In clinical practice, they can be used as immunotherapeutic targets and prognostic predictors in LIHC, which sheds new light on the scientific fields of cuproptosis and LIHC.	2023	Cuproptosis-Related Genes CDK1 and COA6 Involved in the Prognosis Prediction of Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	37215201	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

JD causes huge economic losses to the dairy industry due to reduced milk production and premature culling. Infected animals excrete MAP via feces during the prolonged subclinical stage without exhibiting any clinical signs. Therefore, accurate detection of subclinical stage animals is crucial for successful eradication of JD in the herd. In the current study, we analyzed serum samples of MAP-infected and non-infected cattle to identify potential biomarker candidates. First, we identified 12 differentially expressed serum proteins in subclinical and clinical shedder groups compared to the healthy control group. Second, we conducted ELISA for three selected biomarkers (alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), alpha-1-beta glycoprotein, and transthyretin) and compared their diagnostic performance with that of two commercial ELISA diagnostic kits. Serum A2M levels were significantly higher in the MAP-exposed, subclinical shedder, subclinical non-shedder, and clinical shedder groups than in the healthy control group, suggesting its possible use as a diagnostic biomarker for MAP infection. Furthermore, A2M demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.4%, and a specificity of 100% while the two commercial ELISA kits demonstrated a sensitivity of 67.83 and 73.04% and a specificity of 100%, respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest that measuring A2M by ELISA can be used as a diagnostic tool to detect MAP infection, considerably improving the detection rate of subclinical shedders and MAP-exposed animals that are undetectable using current diagnostic tools.	2021	Alpha-2-Macroglobulin as a New Promising Biomarker Improving the Diagnostic Sensitivity of Bovine Paratuberculosis.	33748212	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Both pathogens are associated with gastric carcinogenesis. H. pylori interferes with iron metabolism, enhancing the synthesis of acute-phase proteins hepcidin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and α-1 glycoprotein (AGP), but we do not know whether EBV does the same. In this study, we correlated the EBV antibody levels and the serum levels of hepcidin, CRP, and AGP in 145 children from boarding schools in Mexico City. We found that children IgG positive to EBV antigens (VCA, EBNA1, and EA) presented hepcidin, AGP, and CRP levels higher than uninfected children. Hepcidin and AGP remained high in children solely infected with EBV, while CRP was only significantly high in coinfected children. We observed positive correlations between hepcidin and EBV IgG antibodies (p < 0.5). Using the TCGA gastric cancer database, we also observed an association between EBV and hepcidin upregulation. The TCGA database also allowed us to analyze the two important pathways controlling hepcidin expression, BMP−SMAD and IL-1β/IL-6. We observed only the IL-1β/IL-6-dependent inflammatory pathway being significantly associated with EBV infection. We showed here for the first time an association between EBV and enhanced levels of hepcidin. Further studies should consider EBV when evaluating iron metabolism and anemia, and whether in the long run this is an important mechanism of undernourishment and EBV gastric carcinogenesis.	2023	Epstein-Barr Virus Infection Is Associated with Elevated Hepcidin Levels.	36675141	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

In elephants, the number of cases is likely rising. The aim of this study was to identify proteins related to tuberculosis infection in elephants, which could then be used for the development of diagnostic tools and/or vaccines. A serum proteomics approach was used to characterize differentially represented proteins in response to <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in Asian elephants (<i>Elaphas maximus</i>). Blood samples were collected from eight elephants, four of which were antibody positive for tuberculosis and four were antibody negative. Proteomics analysis identified 26 significantly dysregulated proteins in response to tuberculosis. Of these, 10 (38%) were identified as immunoglobulin and 16 (62%) as non-immunoglobulin proteins. The results provided new information on the antibody response to mycobacterial infection and biomarkers associated with tuberculosis and protective response to mycobacteria in Asian elephants. Protective mechanisms included defense against infection (Alpha-1-B glycoprotein A1BG, Serpin family A member 1 SERPINA1, Transthyretin TTR), neuroprotection (TTR), and reduced risks of inflammation, infections, and cancer (SERPINA1, Keratin 10 KRT10).

Diverse machine learning or deep learning models have been developed to predict DILI. However, these models have not provided an adequate understanding of the mechanisms leading to DILI. The development of safer drugs requires novel computational approaches that enable the prompt understanding of the mechanism of DILI. In this study, the mechanisms leading to the development of cholestasis, steatosis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis were explored using a semi-automated approach for data gathering and associations. Diverse data from ToxCast, Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD), Reactome, and Open TG-GATEs on reference molecules leading to the development of the respective diseases were extracted. The data were used to create biological networks of the four diseases. As expected, the four networks had several common pathways, and a joint DILI network was assembled. Such biological networks could be used in drug discovery to identify possible molecules of concern as they provide a better understanding of the disease-specific key events. The events can be target-tested to provide indications for potential DILI effects.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43188-022-00124-6.	2022	Semi-automated approach for generation of biological networks on drug-induced cholestasis, steatosis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis.	35865277	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Our aim was to develop a metabolism-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signature to assess the prognosis of BC patients in order to optimize treatment. Metabolism-related genes between breast tumors and normal tissues were screened out, and Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate metabolism-related lncRNAs. In total, five metabolism-related lncRNAs were enrolled to establish prognostic signatures. Kaplan-Meier plots and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated good performance in both training and validation groups. Further analysis demonstrated that the signature was an independent prognostic factor for BC. A nomogram incorporating risk score and tumor stage was then constructed to evaluate the 3 - and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with BC. In conclusion, this study identified a metabolism-related lncRNA signature that can predict RFS of BC patients and established a prognostic nomogram that helps guide the individualized treatment of patients at different risks.	2021	Metabolism-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential biomarkers for predicting risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients.	34254565	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC7722307	10.1186/s12953-020-00167-3	<h4>Background</h4>Sex and age have substantial influence on thyroid function. Sex influences the risk and clinical expression of thyroid disorders (TDs), with age a proposed trigger for the development of TDs. Cardiac function is affected by thyroid hormone levels with gender differences. Accordingly, we investigated the proteomic changes involved in sex based cardiac responses to thyroid dysfunction in elderly mice.<h4>Methods</h4>Aged (18-20 months) male and female C57BL/6 mice were fed diets to create euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid states. Serial echocardiographs were performed to assess heart function. Proteomic changes in cardiac protein profiles were assessed by 2-D DIGE and LC-MS/MS, and a subset confirmed by immunoblotting.<h4>Results</h4>Serial echocardiographs showed ventricular function remained unchanged regardless of treatment. Heart rate and size increased (hyperthyroid) or decreased (hypothyroid) independent of sex. Pairwise comparison between the six groups identified 55 proteins (≥ 1.5-fold difference and p < 0.1). Compared to same-sex controls 26/55 protein changes were in the female hypothyroid heart, whereas 15/55 protein changes were identified in the male hypothyroid, and male and female hyperthyroid heart. The proteins mapped to oxidative phosphorylation, tissue remodeling and inflammatory response pathways.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We identified both predicted and novel proteins with gender specific differential expression in response to thyroid hormone status, providing a catalogue of proteins associated with thyroid dysfunction. Pursuit of these proteins and their involvement in cardiac function will expand our understanding of mechanisms involved in sex-based cardiac response to thyroid dysfunction.	2020	Sex impacts cardiac function and the proteome response to thyroid hormone in aged mice.	33372611	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
NA	10.1080/10495398.2020.1853137	Regulation of estrus plays a crucial role in the livestock industry. It is reported that providing better nutrition can induce early estrus in animals. However, little is known about the major endocrine and physiological mechanisms that could enhance estrus in anestrus animals. Hence in the current research two different groups of yaks, non-breeding season (February-June, NBS) estrus yaks as the experiment group and breeding season (July-September, BS) estrus animals as the control group were compared using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique. Study displayed that cold season supplementation significantly improved growth performance, serum biochemical indicators and reproductive hormone concentrations in yaks. We also identified 25 differentially expressed proteins in yak serum using iTRAQ proteomics. Go and KEGG analysis indicated that calcium signaling pathway and beta-alanine metabolism may be candidate pathways for seasonal estrus induced by nutrition. Differential protein expression was validated using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). The results of this study initially identified A2M, IGF2, A1BG and APOA1 as candidate proteins for seasonal estrus induced by nutrition. Altogether, In conclusion, our results show that providing additional nutrients in the cold season can improve yak productivity and reproductive efficiency, and provide a new reference.	2022	Expression and characterization of the serum proteome from yak induced into estrus by improved nutrition.	33625304	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Saliva samples from eight dogs before and after induced ejaculation were analyzed by proteomic using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling and LC-MS/MS analysis. A total of 33 salivary proteins showed significant changes after the ejaculation process. The up-regulated proteins that showed changes of higher magnitude were mucin-7 (MUC-7), peroxiredoxin-4 (PRDX4) and galectin-3 (LEGALS3) whereas proteins such as alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (A1G1) and alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG) were the most down-regulated. MUC-7 and PRDX4 expression in saliva after ejaculation could be associated with the protective ""environment"" created by the organism to exert pr 3o-fertility activities and antioxidants benefits in spermatozoa. Also LEGALS3 increment could be associated with an improvement of wellbeing and could contribute to a positive global effect in the body. Down-regulations of A1G1 and A1GB proteins found in saliva after ejaculation could be associated with a reduction in systemic inflammation.

PMC9361781	10.1096/fj.202100901rrr	The main active metabolite of Vitamin A, all-trans retinoic acid (RA), is required for proper cellular function and tissue organization. Heart development has a well-defined requirement for RA, but there is limited research on the role of RA in the adult heart. Homeostasis of RA includes regulation of membrane receptors, chaperones, enzymes, and nuclear receptors. Cellular retinol-binding protein, type 1 (CRBP1), encoded by retinol-binding protein, type 1 (Rbp1), regulates RA homeostasis by delivering vitamin A to enzymes for RA synthesis and protecting it from non-specific oxidation. In this work, a multi-omics approach was used to characterize the effect of CRBP1 loss using the Rbp1<sup>-/-</sup> mouse. Retinoid homeostasis was disrupted in Rbp1<sup>-/-</sup> mouse heart tissue, as seen by a 33% and 24% decrease in RA levels in the left and right ventricles, respectively, compared to wild-type mice (WT). To further inform on the effect of disrupted RA homeostasis, we conducted high-throughput targeted metabolomics. A total of 222 metabolite and metabolite combinations were analyzed, with 33 having differential abundance between Rbp1<sup>-/-</sup> and WT hearts. Additionally, we performed global proteome profiling to further characterize the impact of CRBP1 loss in adult mouse hearts. More than 2606 unique proteins were identified, with 340 proteins having differential expression between Rbp1<sup>-/-</sup> and WT hearts. Pathway analysis performed on metabolomic and proteomic data revealed pathways related to cellular metabolism and cardiac metabolism were the most disrupted in Rbp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Together, these studies characterize the effect of CRBP1 loss and reduced RA in the adult heart.	2022	Role of cellular retinol-binding protein, type 1 and retinoid homeostasis in the adult mouse heart: A multi-omic approach.	35253263	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC8536412	10.1155/2021/3440498	<h4>Background</h4>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent disease with an unelucidated pathogenetic mechanism and is mediated by complex molecular interactions of exosomes. Here, we aimed to identify differentially expressed exosome genes for the disease development and prognosis of CHD.<h4>Method</h4>Six CHD samples and 32 normal samples were downloaded from the exoRbase database to identify the candidate genes in the CHD. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. And then, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to investigate the modules in coexpressed genes between CHD samples and normal samples. DEGs and the module of the WGCNA were intersected to obtain the most relevant exosome genes. After that, the function enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction network (PPI) were performed for the particular module using STRING and Cytoscape software. Finally, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze the immune infiltration of exosome genes between CHD samples and normal samples.<h4>Result</h4>We obtain a total of 715 overlapping exosome genes located at the intersection of the DEGs and key modules. The Gene Ontology enrichment of DEGs in the blue module included inflammatory response, neutrophil degranulation, and activation of CHD. In addition, protein-protein networks were constructed, and hub genes were identified, such as LYZ, CAMP, HP, ORM1, and LTF. The immune infiltration profiles varied significantly between normal controls and CHD. Finally, we found that mast cells activated and eosinophils had a positive correlation. B cell memory had a significant negative correlation with B cell naive. Besides, neutrophils and mast cells were significantly increased in CHD patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The underlying mechanism may be related to neutrophil degranulation and the immune response. The hub genes and the difference in immune infiltration identified in the present study may provide new insights into the diagnostic and provide candidate targets for CHD.	2021	Identification of Key Exosome Gene Signature in Mediating Coronary Heart Disease by Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis.	34692829	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

PMC10142111	10.3390/molecules28083323	Glomerulopathies with nephrotic syndrome that are resistant to therapy often progress to end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and require timely and accurate diagnosis. Targeted quantitative urine proteome analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) is a promising tool for early CKD diagnostics that could replace the invasive biopsy procedure. However, there are few studies regarding the development of highly multiplexed MRM assays for urine proteome analysis, and the two MRM assays for urine proteomics described so far demonstrate very low consistency. Thus, the further development of targeted urine proteome assays for CKD is actual task. Herein, a BAK270 MRM assay previously validated for blood plasma protein analysis was adapted for urine-targeted proteomics. Because proteinuria associated with renal impairment is usually associated with an increased diversity of plasma proteins being present in urine, the use of this panel was appropriate. Another advantage of the BAK270 MRM assay is that it includes 35 potential CKD markers described previously. Targeted LC-MRM MS analysis was performed for 69 urine samples from 46 CKD patients and 23 healthy controls, revealing 138 proteins that were found in ≥2/3 of the samples from at least one of the groups. The results obtained confirm 31 previously proposed CKD markers. Combination of MRM analysis with machine learning for data processing was performed. As a result, a highly accurate classifier was developed (AUC = 0.99) that enables distinguishing between mild and severe glomerulopathies based on the assessment of only three urine proteins (GPX3, PLMN, and A1AT or SHBG).	2023	Targeted MRM Quantification of Urinary Proteins in Chronic Kidney Disease Caused by Glomerulopathies.	37110557	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Circulating exosomes containing proteins, lipids and nucleic acids can be ideal diagnostic biomarkers and disease management strategies for SLE. Our aim was to examine the unique expression profiles of circulating exosomal miRNAs and proteins in patients with SLE patients. Using RNA-sequencing and proteomic approaches, we compared the expression patterns of exosomal miRNAs and proteins in the plasma of SLE patients and healthy subjects, and discussed the underlying signaling network of circulating exosomes. We also summarize common molecules (miRNAs and proteins) and pathways shared by our plasma exosomes, as well as previously reported data (PBMC, T cells, B cells and plasma). We identified groups of differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs and proteins in the plasma of SLE patients and healthy controls. We obtained consensus molecules (39 miRNAs, 14 proteins) and 21 signaling pathways that are common in our current study and previous reports. Common molecules (miRNAs and proteins) and pathways shared by our plasma exosomes data and other circulating components data reported previously indicate their potential application in the clinical treatment and diagnosis of SLE disease.	2023	Differential expression of exosomal miRNAs and proteins in the plasma of systemic lupus erythematous patients.	36820039	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC8873249	10.1038/s41598-022-07160-0	Although early intervention may help prevent the progression of bipolar disorder, there are some controversies over early pharmacological intervention. In this study, we recruited 40 subjects in the prodromal stage of BD-II (BP), according to bipolar at-risk state criteria. We compared the expression of their plasma proteins with that of 48 BD-II and 75 healthy control (HC) to identify markers that could be detected in a high-risk state. The multiple reaction monitoring method was used to measure target peptide levels with high accuracy. A total of 26 significant peptides were identified through analysis of variance with multiple comparisons, of which 19 were differentially expressed in the BP group when compared to the BD-II and HC groups. Two proteins were overexpressed in the BP group; and were related to pro-inflammation and impaired neurotransmission. The other under-expressed peptides in the BP group were related to blood coagulation, immune reactions, lipid metabolism, and the synaptic plasticity. In this study, significant markers observed in the BP group have been reported in patients with psychiatric disorders. Overall, the results suggest that the pathophysiological changes included in BD-II had already occurred with BP, thus justifying early pharmacological treatment to prevent disease progression.	2022	Alterations in blood proteins in the prodromal stage of bipolar II disorders.	35210508	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Here we propose Speedy-PASEF, a combination of analytical flow rate chromatography with ion mobility separation of peptide ions, data-independent acquisition and data analysis with the DIA-NN software suite, for conducting fast, high-quality proteomic experiments that require only moderate sample amounts. For instance, using a 500-μl/min flow rate and a 3-minute chromatographic gradient, Speedy-PASEF quantified 5,211 proteins from 2 μg of a mammalian cell-line standard at high quantitative accuracy and precision. We further used Speedy-PASEF to analyze blood plasma samples from a cohort of COVID-19 inpatients, using a 3-minute chromatographic gradient and alternating column regeneration on a dual pump system, for processing 398 samples per day. Speedy-PASEF delivered a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 plasma proteome, allowing classification of the patients according to disease severity and revealing plasma biomarker candidates.

PMC9689510	10.3390/diagnostics12112583	Proteinuria is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and associated complications. However, there is insufficient information on individual protein components in urine and the severity of CKD. We aimed to investigate urinary proteomics and its association with proteinuria and kidney function in early-stage CKD and in healthy individuals. A 24 h urine sample of 42 individuals (21-CKD and 21-healthy individuals) was used for mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis. An exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) was calculated for each protein. Data were analyzed by Mascot software using the SwissProt database and bioinformatics tools. Overall, 298 unique proteins were identified in the cohort; of them, 250 proteins belong to the control group with median (IQR) emPAI 39.1 (19−53) and 142 proteins belong to the CKD group with median (IQR) emPAI 67.8 (49−117). The level of 24 h proteinuria positively correlated with emPAI (r = 0.390, p = 0.011). The emPAI of some urinary proteomics had close positive (ALBU, ZA2G, IGKC) and negative (OSTP, CD59, UROM, KNG1, RNAS1, CD44, AMBP) correlations (r < 0.419, p < 0.001) with 24 h proteinuria levels. Additionally, a few proteins (VTDB, AACT, A1AG2, VTNC, and CD44) significantly correlated with kidney function. In this proteomics study, several urinary proteins correlated with proteinuria and kidney function. Pathway analysis identified subpathways potentially related to early proteinuric CKD, allowing the design of prospective studies that explore their response to therapy and their relationship to long-term outcomes.	2022	Urinary Protein Profiling for Potential Biomarkers of Chronic Kidney Disease: A Pilot Study.	36359427	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
NA	10.1016/j.jneuroim.2020.577359	Multiple sclerosis (MS) manifesting before age 18 years is defined as pediatric MS (pMS). We analysed plasma proteins in pMS by an untargeted proteomic approach. Patients with pMS (Group pMS, n = 33), patients with demyelinating disease not meeting pMS diagnostic criteria (unclassified demyelinating disease, Group U, n = 4) and age-matched healthy subjects (Group C, n = 40) were included. Plasma proteomic analysis was performed using Q-TOF LC/MS. Proteins having fold change >1.2 and found to be statistically different (p < 0.05) between the groups were identified and discussed with a clinical perspective. Group pMS had higher alpha 1B glycoprotein (A1BG), complement factor B (CFB), plasminogen (PLG), alpha-2-antiplasmin (α<sub>2</sub>-AP, SERPINF2), inter alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2 (ITIH2), and lower centrosomal protein of 290 (CEP290) and F-box/LRR-repeat protein 17 (FBXL17) concentrations than Group C. Measurements from Group U, whose definite diagnoses were established as pMS (n = 3) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (n = 1) on follow-up after the study, were statistically close to the results of Group pMS. Plasma protein changes observed in our study were related to the inflammation, coagulation and oxidative stress pathways. If confirmed and validated in larger groups, these results may indicate potential biomarker(s) for demyelinating diseases at proteome level and could encourage studies for the development of novel diagnostic kits.	2020	Analysis of plasma protein biomarkers in childhood onset multiple sclerosis.	32841722	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
NA	NA	<h4>Purpose</h4>Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignant tumor with no obvious characteristics in the early stage of onset and high metastatic ability which results in a low survival. Understanding the detailed process of pancreatic cancer contributes to new treatments to prolong patients' survival.<h4>Methods</h4>We carried out an in-depth analysis by modularization while seeking for critical genes in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer so as to identify the molecular mechanisms of the condition using differential analysis, co-expression module analysis, enrichment analysis, and network connectivity analysis. In light of the hypergeometric test, ncRNA (non-coding RNA) and transcription factors that regulate the module would be predicted.<h4>Results</h4>Conclusively, seven co-expression modules were obtained, in which CPA2 and A1BG were significantly differentially expressed in patients who had pancreatic cancer with active regulation in dysfunction modules. The modular genes significantly participated in second-messenger-mediated signaling as well as cellular calcium homeostasis and also controlled the interactions of neuroactive ligand-receptor. Besides, we identified ncRNA pivot including FENDRR and miR-92a-3p as well as transcription factors pivot including SPI1, STAT5A which significantly regulated the dysfunction module.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study can help reveal core dysfunction modules, potential regulatory factors, and driver genes for pancreatic cancer, enhancing the understanding of its pathogenesis and providing a reference for prediction with respect to the survival time of patients with this condition.	2020	Time series expression patterns reveal the molecular processes of pancreatic cancer progression.	33099939	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9847018	10.1186/s12014-023-09392-2	<h4>Background</h4>Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been considered as an adjuvant therapy for sepsis. However, the novel biomarker to evaluate the benefits of CRRT is limited. The aim of this study was to explore the novel biomarkers involved in the impact of CRRT in pediatric sepsis.<h4>Methods</h4>The serum proteomic profiles on the 7th day after CRRT (CRRT 7th day) compared with before CRRT (CRRT 1st day) was determined in 3 children with sepsis as a discovery set. The screened candidates were confirmed in the validation cohort including patients received CRRT (CRRT group) and without CRRT (non-CRRT group). We defined that pediatric sequential organ failure assessment score (pSOFA) in pediatric patients with sepsis decreased by 2 points or more on the CRRT 1st day compared with CRRT initiation as CRRT responders. The changes of serum biomarkers were compared between CRRT responders and CRRT non-responders. Moreover, correlation analysis was further conducted in pediatric sepsis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 145 differentially expressed proteins were found according to the serum proteomics profiles. By visualizing the interaction between the differential proteins, 6 candidates (Lysozyme C [LYZ], Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein [LRG1], Fibromodulin [FMOD], Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin [SERPINA3], L-selectin [SELL], Monocyte differentiation antigen CD14 [CD14]) were screened. In the validation cohort, serum levels of LYZ and LRG1 showed a higher trend on the CRRT 7th day than that on the 1st day in the non-CRRT group. However, the changes in levels of LYZ and LRG1 on the 7th day was significant in the CRRT group (p = 0.016, p = 0.009, respectively). Moreover, the levels of LYZ and LRG1 on the CRRT 7th day in the CRRT group were significantly higher than that in the non-CRRT group (p < 0.001, p = 0.025). Decreased levels of CD14 were associated with sepsis recovery, but not associated with CRRT. There were no significantly difference in serum FMOD, SERPINA3, and SELL levels. Importantly, serum LYZ and LRG1 levels changed in CRRT responders, but not CRRT non-responders. Further analysis indicated that serum LYZ levels were correlated to total platelet counts, aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), alanine aminotransferase (AST), and albumin levels, and serum LRG1 level were correlated to total platelet count and TBIL levels on the 1st day in the CRRT group. Protein-protein interaction network analysis displayed that serum LYZ and LRG1 were involved in the process of inflammatory response, leucocytes adhesion to vascular endothelial cell, as well as complement activation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Elevated serum LYZ and LRG1 levels are associated with clinical benefits of CRRT during sepsis.	2023	The novel biomarkers for assessing clinical benefits of continuous renal replacement therapy in pediatric sepsis: a pilot study.	36650427	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
NA	10.1016/j.jprot.2020.103979	The emerging technology of urinary proteomics has become an efficient biological approach for identifying biomarkers and characterizing pathogenesis in renal involvement. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between IgAN and HSPN in children, employing LC-MS/MS to perform urinary proteomic analyses using the DIA method. Early-morning spot urine was collected from patients with biopsy-proven IgAN (n = 19) and HSPN (n = 19) prior to treatment and renal biopsy in the Department of Pediatrics, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing, China, and did healthy volunteers (n = 14), from June 2018 to December 2019. Two hundred seventy-six urinary proteins and 125 urinary proteins were determined to be differentially expressed in children with IgAN (n = 4) and HSPN (n = 4), respectively, compared to the urinary proteins of healthy children (n = 4) (p < 0.05). GO analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed proteins of the two groups, which were located in the extracellular matrix and cell membrane, were primarily involved in biological processes, including metabolic processes, immune system processes, cellular adhesion, cell proliferation, signaling, and biological regulation. KEGG analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins of the two groups were associated with cell adhesion molecules, ECM-receptor interactions, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the complement and coagulation cascades, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cholesterol metabolism, and platelet activation. The target proteins (alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG) and afamin (AFM)), which participated in the complement and coagulation cascades and the regulation of complement activation, were further investigated in the independent validation cohort by ELISA. These proteins were significantly increased in children with IgAN (n = 15) and HSPN (n = 15) compared with the proteins observed in healthy controls (n = 10, P < 0.05). The validated results were consistent with the mass spectrometry results. SIGNIFICANCE: IgAN and HSPN both result from the glomerular deposition of abnormally glycosylated IgA1 with mesangial proliferative changes, and both diseases are common glomerulopathies in the pediatric population that are believed to be correlated. Interestingly, our data, by combining urinary proteomic analyses, showed that several uniform enrichment pathways played an important role in the progression of IgAN and HSPN, suggesting that we might reduce the renal involvement of the two diseases in children through these pathways. The same urinary proteins along these pathways were observed to be differentially expressed in children with IgAN and HSPN, implying that these proteins may be potential biomarkers to identify the two diseases. Future studies examining larger cohorts are warranted to confirm the validity of our findings.	2021	Use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to perform urinary proteomic analysis of children with IgA nephropathy and Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis.	32932007	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC8476624	10.1038/s41598-021-98672-8	Insulin has metabolic and vascular effects in the human body. What mechanisms that orchestrate the effects in the microcirculation, and how the responds differ in different tissues, is however not fully understood. It is therefore of interest to search for markers in microdialysate that may be related to the microcirculation. This study aims to identify proteins related to microvascular changes in different tissue compartments after glucose provocation using in vivo microdialysis. Microdialysis was conducted in three different tissue compartments (intracutaneous, subcutaneous and intravenous) from healthy subjects. Microdialysate was collected during three time periods; recovery after catheter insertion, baseline and glucose provocation, and analyzed using proteomics. Altogether, 126 proteins were detected. Multivariate data analysis showed that the differences in protein expression levels during the three time periods, including comparison before and after glucose provocation, were most pronounced in the intracutaneous and subcutaneous compartments. Four proteins with vascular effects were identified (angiotensinogen, kininogen-1, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein and hemoglobin subunit beta), all upregulated after glucose provocation compared to baseline in all three compartments. Glucose provocation is known to cause insulin-induced vasodilation through the nitric oxide pathway, and this study indicates that this is facilitated through the interactions of the RAS (angiotensinogen) and kallikrein-kinin (kininogen-1) systems.	2021	Investigation of proteins important for microcirculation using in vivo microdialysis after glucose provocation: a proteomic study.	34580391	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC10014319	10.1631/jzus.b2200405	A series of chemotherapeutic drugs that induce DNA damage, such as cisplatin (DDP), are standard clinical treatments for ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, and other diseases that lack effective targeted drug therapy. Drug resistance is one of the main factors limiting their application. Sensitizers can overcome the drug resistance of tumor cells, thereby enhancing the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we aimed to identify marketable drugs that could be potential chemotherapy sensitizers and explore the underlying mechanisms. We found that the alcohol withdrawal drug disulfiram (DSF) could significantly enhance the antitumor activity of DDP. JC-1 staining, propidium iodide (PI) staining, and western blotting confirmed that the combination of DSF and DDP could enhance the apoptosis of tumor cells. Subsequent RNA sequencing combined with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) pathway enrichment analysis and cell biology studies such as immunofluorescence suggested an underlying mechanism: DSF makes cells more vulnerable to DNA damage by inhibiting the Fanconi anemia (FA) repair pathway, exerting a sensitizing effect to DNA damaging agents including platinum chemotherapy drugs. Thus, our study illustrated the potential mechanism of action of DSF in enhancing the antitumor effect of DDP. This might provide an effective and safe solution for combating DDP resistance in clinical treatment.	2023	Disulfiram enhances the antitumor activity of cisplatin by inhibiting the Fanconi anemia repair pathway.	36915997	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Nineteen (90%) proteins were confirmed as upregulated in preeclampsia cases. Among them, two proteins, ceruloplasmin and serpin A7, were upregulated at 20-24 weeks and 30-34 weeks of gestation (p < 0.05) in cases of preeclampsia, and could have served to identify 60% of women who subsequently developed preeclampsia and/or fetal growth restriction at 20-24 weeks of gestation, and 78% at 30-34 weeks, for a false-positive rate of 10%. Proteomic profiling of maternal urine can differentiate women with and without preeclampsia. Several proteins including ceruloplasmin and serpin A7 are upregulated in maternal urine before the diagnosis of preeclampsia and potentially fetal growth restriction.	2021	Proteomic Analysis of Maternal Urine for the Early Detection of Preeclampsia and Fetal Growth Restriction. 	34682802	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC6557307	10.1093/gbe/evz102	Receptors of the leukocyte receptor cluster (LRC) play a range of important functions in the human immune system. However, the evolution of the LRC remains poorly understood, even in m\ammals not to mention nonmammalian vertebrates. We conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the LRC-related genes in the publicly available genomes of six species that represent eutherian, marsupial, and monotreme lineages of mammals. As a result, the LRCs of African elephant and armadillo were characterized, two new genes, IGSF1 and A1BG, were attributed to the LRC of eutherian mammals, the LRC gene content was substantially extended in the short-tailed opossum and Tasmanian devil and, finally, four LRC genes were identified in the platypus genome. These findings have for the first time provided a solid basis for inference of the LRC phylogeny across mammals. Our analysis suggests that the mammalian LRC family likely derived from two ancestral genes, which evolved in a lineage-specific manner by expansion/contraction, extensive exon shuffling, and sequence divergence. The striking structural and functional diversity of eutherian LRC molecules appears largely lineage specific. The only family member retained in all the three mammalian lineages is a collagen-binding receptor OSCAR. Strong sequence conservation of a transmembrane domain known to associate with FcRγ suggests an adaptive role of this domain subtype in the LRC evolution.	2019	Unraveling the LRC Evolution in Mammals: IGSF1 and A1BG Provide the Keys.	31106814	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Here we present cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) protein profiles of pregnant women who subsequently delivered at spontaneous preterm or term, aiming to identify differentially expressed CVF proteins in PTB and term birth.<h4>Methods</h4>The CVF proteome of women who sequentially delivered at preterm and term was analyzed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled with two-dimensional nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D-nLC-MS/MS). We compared the CVF proteome of PTB (n = 5) and control subjects (term birth, n = 7) using pooled control CVF (term birth, n = 20) as spike-in standard.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 1294 CVF proteins, of which 605 were newly identified proteins. Of 990 proteins quantified in both PTB and term birth, 52 proteins were significantly up/down-regulated in PTB compared to term birth. The differentially expressed proteins were functionally associated to immune response, endopeptidase inhibitors and structural constituent of cytoskeleton. Finally, we confirm the down-regulation of SERPINB7 (a serine-type protease inhibitor) in PTB compared to control by Western blot.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, our study provide quantitative CVF proteome profiles of pregnant women who ultimately delivered at preterm and term. These promising results could help to improve the understanding of PTB etiology and to discover biomarkers for asymptomatic PTB.	2021	Quantitative proteomic profiling of Cervicovaginal fluid from pregnant women with term and preterm birth.	33588889	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
NA	10.1002/jcb.28315	Extensive evidence indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulates the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the expression and biological function of lncRNA A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) were poorly known in HCC. Here, we found the underexpression of A1BG-AS1 in HCC via analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Further analyses confirmed that A1BG-AS1 expression in HCC was markedly lower than that in noncancerous tissues based on our HCC cohort. Clinical association analysis revealed that low A1BG-AS1 expression correlated with poor prognostic features, such as microvascular invasion, high tumor grade, and advanced tumor stage. Follow-up data indicated that low A1BG-AS1 level evidently correlated with poor clinical outcomes of HCC patients. Moreover, forced expression of A1BG-AS1 repressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Conversely, A1BG-AS1 knockdown promoted these malignant behaviors in HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, A1BG-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA by directly sponging miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Notably, miR-216a-5p restoration rescued A1BG-AS1 attenuated proliferation, migration and invasion of HCCLM3 cells. A1BG-AS1 positively regulated the levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog and SMAD family member 7, which were reduced by miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Altogether, we conclude that A1BG-AS1 exerts a tumor suppressive role in HCC progression.	2019	lncRNA A1BG-AS1 suppresses proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting miR-216a-5p.	30556161	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Proteome profiling may help to identify important proteins and find the pathogenesis Cirrhosis is a condition where liver is damaged and loses its efficiency, and has the high rate of mortality in the world. Proteome profiling may help to identify important proteins and find the pathogenesis.<h4>Methods</h4>Here, by the application of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE), combined with (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS), proteome profile of decompensated HCV cirrhosis is determined compared to healthy matched controls. Furthermore, Cytoscape has used network analysis. The proteome comparison between two groups identified proteins with significant expression changes (p<0.05 and fold change ≥ 1.5).<h4>Results</h4>We found upregulation of IGHA1, C3, A1BG, IGKC and one isoform of HP. Also, lower expression of APOA4 and the other spot of HP in advanced cirrhosis patients were revealed based on HCV compared to matched controls. According to network analysis, ALB has been introduced as a key protein, which may play an important role in pathogenesis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Integration of the proteomics with protein interaction data led to the identification of several novel key proteins related to the immune system that may reflect the long-term effects of hepatitis C virus on the liver, and can introduce as therapeutic targets for advanced HCV- cirrhosis.	2020	Proteomic study of advanced cirrhosis based on HCV to reveal potential biomarkers.	33585012	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9356844	10.1155/2022/1831211	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most prevalent type of malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. In the current study, we characterized the landscape of genomic alterations in CRC patients. Based on the results of whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified 31 significantly mutated genes. Among them, several genes including TP53, KRAS, APC, PI3KCA, and BRAF were reported as significantly mutated genes in previous studies. In the current study, the most frequently mutated gene was TP53, which encodes tumor suppressor p53, affecting approximately 60% of CRC patients. In addition, we performed the expression profiles of significantly mutated genes between the normal group and tumor groups and identified 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); among them, CSMD3, DCHS2, LRP2, RYR2, and ZFHX4 were significantly negatively correlated with PFS. Moreover, consensus clustering analysis for CRC based on the expression of significantly somatic mutated genes was performed. In total, three subtypes of CRC were identified in CRC, including cluster1 (<i>n</i> = 453), cluster2 (<i>n</i> = 158), and cluster 3 (<i>n</i> = 9), based on expression level of significantly somatic mutated genes. Clinicopathological features analysis showed subtype C1 had the longest progression-free survival (PFS) with median time of 8.2 years, while subtypes C2 and C3 had 4.1 and 2.7 years of PFS, respectively. Moreover, we found three subtypes related to tumor infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Immune infiltration analysis showed the tumor infiltration levels of B cell native, T cell CD8+, T cell CD4+ memory activated, T cell gamma delta, NK cell resting, macrophage M0, macrophage M2, myeloid dendritic cell activated, mast cell activated, and mast cell resting significantly changed among the three groups, demonstrating the three subgroups classified by 22 somatically significantly mutated genes had a high capacity to differentiate patients with different immune statuses, which is helpful for the prediction of immunotherapy response of CRC patients. Our findings could provide novel potential predictive indicators for CRC prognosis and therapy targets for CRC immunotherapy.	2022	Comprehensive Analysis of Genomic and Expression Data Identified Potential Markers for Predicting Prognosis and Immune Response in CRC.	35975176	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9396478	10.4103/1673-5374.346461	The effect of platelet-rich plasma on nerve regeneration remains controversial. In this study, we established a rabbit model of sciatic nerve small-gap defects with preserved epineurium and then filled the gaps with platelet-rich plasma. Twenty-eight rabbits were divided into the following groups (7 rabbits/group): model, low-concentration PRP (2.5-3.5-fold concentration of whole blood platelets), medium-concentration PRP (4.5-6.5-fold concentration of whole blood platelets), and high-concentration PRP (7.5-8.5-fold concentration of whole blood platelets). Electrophysiological and histomorphometrical assessments and proteomics analysis were used to evaluate regeneration of the sciatic nerve. Our results showed that platelet-rich plasma containing 4.5-6.5- and 7.5-8.5-fold concentrations of whole blood platelets promoted repair of sciatic nerve injury. Proteomics analysis was performed to investigate the possible mechanism by which platelet-rich plasma promoted nerve regeneration. Proteomics analysis showed that after sciatic nerve injury, platelet-rich plasma increased the expression of integrin subunit β-8 (ITGB8), which participates in angiogenesis, and differentially expressed proteins were mainly enriched in focal adhesion pathways. Additionally, two key proteins, ribosomal protein S27a (RSP27a) and ubiquilin 1 (UBQLN1), which were selected after protein-protein interaction analysis, are involved in the regulation of ubiquitin levels in vivo. These data suggest that platelet-rich plasma promotes peripheral nerve regeneration after sciatic nerve injury by affecting angiogenesis and intracellular ubiquitin levels.	2023	Platelet-rich plasma promotes peripheral nerve regeneration after sciatic nerve injury.	35900433	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

PMC8669964	10.3389/fcell.2021.781285	There are many types of cancers. Although they share some hallmarks, such as proliferation and metastasis, they are still very different from many perspectives. They grow on different organ or tissues. Does each cancer have a unique gene expression pattern that makes it different from other cancer types? After the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, there are more and more pan-cancer studies. Researchers want to get robust gene expression signature from pan-cancer patients. But there is large variance in cancer patients due to heterogeneity. To get robust results, the sample size will be too large to recruit. In this study, we tried another approach to get robust pan-cancer biomarkers by using the cell line data to reduce the variance. We applied several advanced computational methods to analyze the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) gene expression profiles which included 988 cell lines from 20 cancer types. Two feature selection methods, including Boruta, and max-relevance and min-redundancy methods, were applied to the cell line gene expression data one by one, generating a feature list. Such list was fed into incremental feature selection method, incorporating one classification algorithm, to extract biomarkers, construct optimal classifiers and decision rules. The optimal classifiers provided good performance, which can be useful tools to identify cell lines from different cancer types, whereas the biomarkers (e.g. NCKAP1, TNFRSF12A, LAMB2, FKBP9, PFN2, TOM1L1) and rules identified in this work may provide a meaningful and precise reference for differentiating multiple types of cancer and contribute to the personalized treatment of tumors.	2021	Identification of Pan-Cancer Biomarkers Based on the Gene Expression Profiles of Cancer Cell Lines.	34917619	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9913626	10.3390/cancers15030641	Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an asbestos-associated, highly aggressive cancer characterized by late-stage diagnosis and poor prognosis. Gold standards for diagnosis are pleural biopsy and cytology of pleural effusion (PE), both of which are limited by low sensitivity and markedly inter-observer variations. Therefore, the assessment of PE biomarkers is considered a viable and objective diagnostic tool for MPM diagnosis. We applied a novel affinity-enrichment mass spectrometry-based proteomics method for explorative analysis of pleural effusions from a prospective cohort of 84 patients referred for thoracoscopy due to clinical suspicion of MPM. Protein biomarkers with a high capability to discriminate MPM from non-MPM patients were identified, and a Random Forest algorithm was applied for building classification models. Immunohistology of pleural biopsies confirmed MPM in 40 patients and ruled out MPM in 44 patients. Proteomic analysis of pleural effusions identified panels of proteins with excellent diagnostic properties (90-100% sensitivities, 89-98% specificities, and AUC 0.97-0.99) depending on the specific protein combination. Diagnostic proteins associated with cancer growth included galactin-3 binding protein, testican-2, haptoglobin, Beta ig-h3, and protein AMBP. Moreover, we also confirmed previously reported diagnostic accuracies of the MPM markers fibulin-3 and mesothelin measured by two complementary mass spectrometry-based methods. In conclusion, a novel affinity-enrichment mass spectrometry-based proteomics identified panels of proteins in pleural effusion with extraordinary diagnostic accuracies, which are described here for the first time as biomarkers for MPM.	2023	Identification of Highly Sensitive Pleural Effusion Protein Biomarkers for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma by Affinity-Based Quantitative Proteomics.	36765599	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Patients were divided into complete responder (CR) and non-complete responder (nCR) groups. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of 79 independent FFPE tissue samples was performed to validate the predictive ability of proteomic biomarker candidates. A total of 3637 proteins were identified, and the expression of 498 proteins was confirmed at significantly different levels (differentially expressed proteins-DEPs) between two groups. In Gene Ontology enrichment analyses, DEPs enriched in biological processes in the CR group included proteins linked to cytoskeletal organization, immune response processes, and vesicle-associated protein transport processes, whereas DEPs in the nCR group were associated with biosynthesis, transcription, and translation processes. Dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) was selected as the most predictive biomarker in machine learning algorithm analysis. Further IHC validation ultimately confirmed DUOX2 as a potential biomarker for predicting the response of nCR to CCRT. In conclusion, this study suggests that the treatment response to RT may be affected by the pre-treatment tumor microenvironment. DUOX2 is a potential biomarker for the early prediction of nCR after CCRT.	2022	Dual Oxidase 2 (DUOX2) as a Proteomic Biomarker for Predicting Treatment Response to Chemoradiation Therapy for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer: Using High-Throughput Proteomic Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithm.	36361712	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC9641302	10.1186/s12014-022-09377-7	Most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 display mild symptoms with good prognosis, while 20% of patients suffer from severe viral pneumonia and up to 5% may require intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which could be accompanied by multiorgan failure.Plasma proteomics provide valuable and unbiased information about disease progression and therapeutic candidates. Recent proteomic studies have identified molecular changes in plasma of COVID-19 patients that implied significant dysregulation of several aspects of the inflammatory response accompanied by a general metabolic suppression. However, which of these plasma alterations are associated with disease severity remains only partly characterized.A known limitation of proteomic studies of plasma samples is the large difference in the macromolecule abundance, with concentration spanning at least 10 orders of magnitude. To improve the coverage of plasma contents, we performed a deep proteomic analysis of plasma from 10 COVID-19 patients with severe/fatal pneumonia compared to 10 COVID-19 patients with pneumonia who did not require ICU admission (non-ICU). To this aim, plasma samples were first depleted of the most abundant proteins, trypsin digested and peptides subjected to a high pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation before LC-MS analysis.These results highlighted an increase of proteins involved in neutrophil and platelet activity and acute phase response, which is significantly higher in severe/fatal COVID-19 patients when compared to non-ICU ones. Importantly, these changes are associated with a selective induction of complement cascade factors in severe/fatal COVID-19 patients. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD036491. Among these alterations, we confirmed by ELISA that higher levels of the neutrophil granule proteins DEFA3 and LCN2 are present in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission when compared to non-ICU and healthy donors.Altogether, our study provided an in-depth view of plasma proteome changes that occur in COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity, which can be helpful to identify therapeutic strategies to improve the disease outcome.	2022	Proteomic analysis identifies a signature of disease severity in the plasma of COVID-19 pneumonia patients associated to neutrophil, platelet and complement activation.	36348270	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Thus, we aimed to establish an IRL-based tool to improve prognosis prediction in BC patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We obtained IRL expression profiles in large BC cohorts (N = 911) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, in light of the correlation between each IRL and recurrence-free survival (RFS), we screened prognostic IRL signatures to construct a novel RFS nomogram via a Cox regression model. Subsequently, the performance of the IRL-based model was evaluated through discrimination, calibration ability, risk stratification ability and decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 52 IRLs were obtained from TCGA. Based on multivariate Cox regression analyses, four IRLs (A1BG-AS1, AC004477.3, AC004585.1 and AC004854.2) and two risk parameters (tumor subtype and TNM stage) were utilized as independent indicators to develop a novel prognostic model. In terms of predictive accuracy, the IRL-based model was distinctly superior to the TNM staging system (AUC: 0.728 VS 0.673, P = 0.010). DCA indicated that our nomogram had favorable clinical practicability. In addition, risk stratification analysis showed that the IRL-based tool efficiently divided BC patients into high- and low-risk groups (P < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel IRL-based model was constructed to predict the risk of 5-year RFS in BC. Our model can improve the predictive power of the TNM staging system and identify high-risk patients with tumor recurrence to implement more appropriate treatment strategies.	2020	Molecular characterization of breast cancer: a potential novel immune-related lncRNAs signature.	33160384	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

Functional enrichment analysis tool DAVID ver. 6.8 categorized: extracellular proteins (38%), intracellular (31%), protein-containing complex (13%), organelle (9%), membrane proteins (6%), supramolecular complex (2%), and 1% in the cell junction. Molecular function revealed: binding activity (42%), catalytic activity (31%), regulatory activity (14%), and structural activity (7%). Molecular transducer, transporter, and transcription regulator activity together contributed to 6%.

PMC8517989	10.7150/jca.63351	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical drivers and suppressors of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The downregulation of transmembrane protein 220 antisense RNA 1 (TMEM220-AS1) is correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. Nevertheless, the role of TMEM220-AS1 in HCC and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, TMEM220-AS1 levels were markedly reduced in HCC tissues compared with noncancerous tissues. TMEM220-AS1 downregulation was confirmed in HCC cell lines. TMEM220-AS1 expression was associated with tumor stage, venous infiltration, tumor size, and survival of HCC patients. TMEM220-AS1 overexpression suppressed the migration, invasion, and proliferation of HCC cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of TMEM220-AS1 increased TMEM220 levels in HCC cells. Decreased TMEM220 levels were observed in HCC tissues and cell lines. TMEM220 expression was positively correlated with TMEM220-AS1 levels in HCC tissue samples and TMEM220 downregulation was significantly correlated with reduced patient survival. TMEM220 overexpression suppressed HCC cell proliferation and mobility. TMEM220 knockdown eliminated the suppressive effect of TMEM220-AS1 in HCCLM3 cells. Mechanistically, TMEM220 overexpression reduced the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and decreased MYC, Cyclin D1, and Snail1 mRNA levels in HCCLM3 cells. BIO, a GSK3β inhibitor, eliminated TMEM220-induced Wnt/β-catenin pathway inactivation and inhibited HCC cell proliferation and mobility. In conclusion, TMEM220-AS1 and TMEM220 were expressed at low levels in HCC patients. TMEM220-AS1 inhibited the malignant behavior of HCC cells by enhancing TMEM220 expression and subsequently inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.	2021	LncRNA TMEM220-AS1 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the TMEM220/β-catenin axis.	34659569	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol

However, the function of lncRNAs remains poorly understood, especially in the context of infection with low-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs). To further understanding on this issue, we investigated lncRNA expression in HPV-induced common warts.<h4>Methods</h4>A publicly available high-throughput sequencing dataset for common warts was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). lncRNA profiles were generated using the NetworkAnalyst 3.0 workflow, and a list of differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs in common warts was identified and inputted into the ENCODE, RegNetwork, DisGeNet, and miRNet platforms.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 54 lncRNAs were revealed to be significantly dysregulated in common warts. Of these 54 lncRNAs, 24 and 30 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The most significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs in common warts included the <i>CERNA2</i>, <i>LINC02159</i>, <i>SH3PXD2A-AS1</i>, and <i>UNC5B-AS1</i> genes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current findings suggest that HPV-induced warts impact the host lncRNA transcriptome. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the impact of low-risk HPV infection on lncRNA expression profiles.	2022	Network analysis of long non-coding RNA expression profiles in common warts.	36458289	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC6437869	10.1186/s12933-019-0846-9	<h4>Background</h4>Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) typically have normal or even elevated plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations; however, HDL protein composition can be altered without a change in cholesterol content. Alteration of the HDL proteome can result in dysfunctional HDL particles with reduced ability to protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective of this study was to compare the HDL proteomes of youth with T1DM and healthy controls (HC) and to evaluate the influence of glycemic control on HDL protein composition.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a cross-sectional case-control study. Blood samples were obtained from patients with T1DM and HC. HDL was isolated from plasma by size-exclusion chromatography and further purified using a lipid binding resin. The HDL proteome was analyzed by mass spectrometry using label-free SWATH peptide quantification.<h4>Results</h4>Samples from 26 patients with T1DM and 13 HC were analyzed and 78 HDL-bound proteins were measured. Youth with T1DM had significantly increased amounts of complement factor H related protein 2 (FHR2; adjusted P < 0.05), compared to HC. When patients were analyzed based on glucose control, several trends emerged. Some proteins were altered in T1DM and not influenced by glycemic control (e.g. FHR2) while others were partially or completely corrected with optimal glucose control (e.g. alpha-1-beta glycoprotein, A1BG). In a subgroup of poorly controlled T1DM patients, inter alpha trypsin inhibitor 4 (ITIH4) was dramatically elevated (P < 0.0001) and this was partially reversed in patients with optimal glucose control. Some proteins including complement component C3 (CO3) and albumin (ALB) were significantly different only in T1DM patients with optimal glucose control, suggesting a possible effect of exogenous insulin.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Youth with T1DM have proteomic alterations of their HDL compared to HC, despite similar concentration of HDL cholesterol. The influence of these compositional changes on HDL function are not yet known.

PMC8195627	10.3389/fonc.2021.665388	<h4>Background</h4>Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is encoded by the solute carrier family 2A1 (SLC2A1) gene and is one of the glucose transporters with the greatest affinity for glucose. Abnormal expression of GLUT1 is associated with a variety of cancers. However, the biological role of GLUT1 in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) remains to be determined.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed the expression of GLUT1 in pan-cancer and ESCA as well as clinicopathological analysis through multiple databases. Use R and STRING to perform GO/KEGG function enrichment and PPI analysis for GLUT1 co-expression. TIMER and CIBERSORT were used to analyze the relationship between GLUT1 expression and immune infiltration in ESCA. The TCGA ESCA cohort was used to analyze the relationship between GLUT1 expression and m6A modification in ESCA, and to construct a regulatory network in line with the ceRNA hypothesis.<h4>Results</h4>GLUT1 is highly expressed in a variety of tumors including ESCA, and is closely related to histological types and histological grade. GO/KEGG functional enrichment analysis revealed that GLUT1 is closely related to structural constituent of cytoskeleton, intermediate filament binding, cell-cell adheres junction, epidermis development, and P53 signaling pathway. PPI shows that GLUT1 is closely related to TP53, GIPC1 and INS, and these three proteins all play an important role in tumor proliferation. CIBERSORT analysis showed that GLUT1 expression is related to the infiltration of multiple immune cells. When GLUT1 is highly expressed, the number of memory B cells decreases. ESCA cohort analysis found that GLUT1 expression was related to 7 m6A modifier genes. Six possible crRNA networks in ESCA were constructed by correlation analysis, and all these ceRNA networks contained GLUT1.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GLUT1 can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of ESCA, and is related to tumor immune infiltration, m6A modification and ceRNA network.	2021	Comprehensive Analysis of GLUT1 Immune Infiltrates and ceRNA Network in Human Esophageal Carcinoma.	34123828	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC7036866	10.3390/molecules25030619	Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) at a current clinical level is still hardly diagnosed, especially with regard to nascent tumors, which are typically asymptotic. Searching for reliable biomarkers of early diagnosis is an extremely essential task. Identification of specific post-translational modifications (PTM) may also significantly improve net benefits and tailor the process of CRC recognition. We examined depleted plasma samples obtained from 41 healthy volunteers and 28 patients with CRC at different stages to conduct comparative proteome-scaled analysis. The main goal of the study was to establish a constellation of protein markers in combination with their PTMs and semi-quantitative ratios that may support and realize the distinction of CRC until the disease has a poor clinical manifestation. Results: Proteomic analysis revealed 119 and 166 proteins for patients in stages I-II and III-IV, correspondingly. Plenty of proteins (44 proteins) reflected conditions of the immune response, lipid metabolism, and response to stress, but only a small portion of them were significant (p < 0.01) for distinguishing stages I-II of CRC. Among them, some cytokines (Clusterin (CLU), C4b-binding protein (C4BP), and CD59 glycoprotein (CD59), etc.) were the most prominent and the lectin pathway was specifically enhanced in patients with CRC. Significant alterations in Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chains (ITIH1, ITIH2, ITIH3, and ITIH4) levels were also observed due to their implication in tumor growth and the malignancy process. Other markers (Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 2 (ORM2), Alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG), Haptoglobin (HP), and Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG1), etc.) were found to create an ambiguous core involved in cancer development but also to exactly promote tumor progression in the early stages. Additionally, we identified post-translational modifications, which according to the literature are associated with the development of colorectal cancer, including kininogen 1 protein (T327-p), alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (S138-p) and newly identified PTMs, i.e., vitamin D-binding protein (K75-ac and K370-ac) and plasma protease C1 inhibitor (Y294-p), which may also contribute and negatively impact on CRC progression. Conclusions: The contribution of cytokines and proteins of the extracellular matrix is the most significant factor in CRC development in the early stages. This can be concluded since tumor growth is tightly associated with chronic aseptic inflammation and concatenated malignancy related to loss of extracellular matrix stability. Due attention should be paid to Apolipoprotein E (APOE), Apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1), and Apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB) because of their impact on the malfunction of DNA repair and their capability to regulate mTOR and PI3K pathways. The contribution of the observed PTMs is still equivocal, but a significant decrease in the likelihood between modified and native proteins was not detected confidently.	2020	Revelation of Proteomic Indicators for Colorectal Cancer in Initial Stages of Development. 	32023884	A1BG-AS	A1BG-AS1	secondary_symbol
PMC6615284	10.1186/s12864-019-5931-7	<h4>Background</h4>The production of foam nests is one of the strategies that has evolved to allow some anuran species to protect their eggs and larvae. Despite considerable knowledge of the biochemical components of and construction behavior leading to anuran foam nests, little is known about the molecular basis of foam nest construction. Rhacophorus omeimontis presents an arboreal foam-nesting strategy during the breeding season. To better understand the molecular mechanism of foam nest production, transcriptome sequencing was performed using the oviduct of female R. omeimontis during the period when foam nest production began and the period when foam nest production was finished.<h4>Results</h4>The transcriptomes of six oviduct samples of R. omeimontis were obtained using Illumina sequencing. A total of 84,917 unigenes were obtained, and 433 genes (270 upregulated and 163 downregulated) were differentially expressed between the two periods. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched in extracellular space and extracellular region based on Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and in the pathways of two-component system, cell adhesion molecules, steroid hormone biosynthesis and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Specifically, genes encoding lectins, surfactant proteins and immunity components were highly expressed when the foam nest construction began, indicating that the constituents of foam nests in R. omeimontis were likely a mixture of surfactant, lectins and immune defense proteins. During the period when foam nest production was finished, genes related to lipid metabolism, steroid hormone and immune defense were highly expressed, indicating their important roles in regulating the process of foam nesting.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides a rich list of potential genes involved in the production of foam nests in R. omeimontis. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of foam nest construction and will facilitate further studies of R. omeimontis.	2019	Transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes in the oviduct of Rhacophorus omeimontis provides insights into foam nest construction.	31286852	CPAMD9	A2ML1	secondary_symbol

Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) are a viable source of cell therapy for diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, little is known about the impact of gestational age of the donor on the quality of hAEC-derived EVs.<h4>Aims</h4>To determine the impact of gestational age on hAEC-derived EVs in experimental BPD.<h4>Results</h4>Term hAEC-derived EVs displayed a significantly higher density of surface epitopes (CD142 and CD133) and induced greater macrophage phagocytosis compared to preterm hAEC-EVs. However, T cell proliferation was more significantly suppressed by preterm hAEC-EVs. Using a model of experimental BPD, we observed that term but not preterm hAEC-EVs improved tissue-to-airspace ratio and septal crest density. While both term and preterm hAEC-EVs reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines on postnatal day 7, the improvement in lung injury was associated with increased type II alveolar cells which was only observed in term hAEC-EV treatment group. Furthermore, only neonatal term hAEC-EVs reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, mitigated pulmonary hypertension and protected against right ventricular hypertrophy at 6 weeks of age.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Term hAEC-EVs, but not preterm hAEC-EVs, have therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of BPD-like lung injury. Therefore, the impact of donor criteria should be considered when applying perinatal cells-derived EV therapy for clinical use.	2022	Assessing the impact of gestational age of donors on the efficacy of amniotic epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia.	35550006	CPAMD9	A2ML1	secondary_symbol
PMC3423619	10.1210/en.2012-1335	Preterm birth is a global health issue impacting millions of mothers and babies. However, the etiology of preterm birth is not clearly understood. Our recent finding that premature decidual senescence with terminal differentiation is a cause of preterm birth in mice with uterine Trp53 deletion, encoding p53 protein, led us to explore other potential factors that are related to preterm birth. Using proteomics approaches, here, we show that 183 candidate proteins show significant changes in deciduae with Trp53 deletion as compared with normal deciduae. Functional categorization of these proteins unveiled new pathways that are influenced by p53. In particular, down-regulation of a cluster of antioxidant enzymes in p53-deficient deciduae suggests that increased oxidative stress could be one cause of preterm birth in mice harboring uterine deletion of Trp53.	2012	Uterine deletion of Trp53 compromises antioxidant responses in the mouse decidua.	22759378	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC6901558	10.1038/s41598-019-54566-4	Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) undergo a dormant state in the distant metastatic site(s) before becoming overt metastatic diseases. In prostate cancer (PCa), bone metastasis can occur years after prostatectomy, suggesting that bone may provide dormancy-inducing factors. To search for these factors, we prepared conditioned media (CM) from calvariae. Using live-cell imaging, we found that Calvarial-CM treatment increased cellular quiescence in C4-2B4 PCa cells. Mass spectrometry analysis of Calvarial-CM identified 132 secreted factors. Western blot and ELISA analyses confirmed the presence of several factors, including DKK3, BMP1, neogenin and vasorin in the Calvarial-CM. qRT-PCR analysis of total calvariae versus isolated osteoblasts showed that DKK3, BMP1, vasorin and neogenin are mainly expressed by osteoblasts, while MIA, LECT1, NGAL and PEDF are expressed by other calvarial cells. Recombinant human DKK3, BMP1, vasorin, neogenin, MIA and NGAL treatment increased cellular quiescence in both C4-2b and C4-2B4 PCa cells. Mechanistically, DKK3, vasorin and neogenin, but not BMP1, increased dormancy through activating the p38MAPK signaling pathway. Consistently, DKK3, vasorin and neogenin failed to induce dormancy in cells expressing dominant-negative p38αMAPK while BMP1 remained active, suggesting that BMP1 uses an alternative dormancy signaling pathway. Thus, bone secretes multiple dormancy-inducing factors that employ distinct signaling pathways to induce DTC dormancy in bone.	2019	Bone secreted factors induce cellular quiescence in prostate cancer cells.	31819067	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC6316452	10.3390/v10120670	Murine herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) productively infects mouse lungs, exhibiting a complex pathology characteristic of both acute viral infections and chronic respiratory diseases. We sought to discover proteins differentially expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from mice infected with MHV-68. Mice were infected intranasally with MHV-68. After nine days, as the lytic phase of infection resolved, differential BAL proteins were identified by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Of 23 unique proteins, acute phase proteins, vitamin A transport, and oxidative stress response factors Pdx6 and EC-SOD (Sod3) were enriched. Correspondingly, iNOS2 was induced in lung tissue by seven days post-infection. Oxidative stress was partly a direct result of MHV-68 infection, as reactive oxygen species (ROS) were induced in cultured murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human lung A549 cells infected with MHV-68. Finally, mice infected with a recombinant MHV-68 co-expressing inflammatory cytokine murine interleukin 6 (IL6) showed exacerbated oxidative stress and soluble type I collagen characteristic of tissue recovery. Thus, oxidative stress appears to be a salient feature of MHV-68 pathogenesis, in part caused by lytic replication of the virus and IL6. Proteins and small molecules in lung oxidative stress networks therefore may provide new therapeutic targets to ameliorate respiratory virus infections.	2018	Proteomics of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid Reveals a Lung Oxidative Stress Response in Murine Herpesvirus-68 Infection.	30486363	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC5037698	10.3390/ijms17091419	The nontoxic heat-labile toxin (LT) B subunit (LTB) was used as mucosal adjuvant experimentally. However, the mechanism of LTB adjuvant was still unclear. The LTB and enterovirus 71 (EV71) VP1 subunit (EVP1) were constructed in pET32 and expressed in E. coli BL21, respectively. The immunogenicity of purified EVP1 and the adjuvanticity of LTB were evaluated via intranasal immunization EVP1 plus LTB in Balb/c mice. In order to elucidate the proteome change triggered by the adjuvant of LTB, the proteomic profiles of LTB, EVP1, and LTB plus EVP1 were quantitatively analyzed by iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation; liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) in murine macrophage RAW264.7. The proteomic data were analyzed by bioinformatics and validated by western blot analysis. The predicted protein interactions were confirmed using LTB pull-down and the LTB processing pathway was validated by confocal microscopy. The results showed that LTB significantly boosted EVP1 specific systematic and mucosal antibodies. A total of 3666 differential proteins were identified in the three groups. Pathway enrichment of proteomic data predicted that LTB upregulated the specific and dominant MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway and the protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (PPER) pathway, whereas LTB or EVP1 did not significantly upregulate these two signaling pathways. Confocal microscopy and LTB pull-down assays confirmed that the LTB adjuvant was endocytosed and processed through endocytosis (ENS)-lysosomal-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) system.	2016	Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Escherichia coli Heat-Labile Toxin B Subunit (LTB) with Enterovirus 71 (EV71) Subunit VP1. 	27618897	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol

NA	10.1016/j.mce.2005.10.004	The alpha 2 macroglobulins (A2M) are a family of abundant plasma proteins produced predominantly by the mammalian liver. Pregnancy zone proteins (PZP) of humans and rats are A2M family members that bind a wide variety of macromolecules including the important pregnancy-associated molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor, placenta growth factor and glycodelin (also called PP14). Recently, a mouse gene analogous to PZP (A2M of pregnancy or A2Mp) was cloned. A2Mp has a unique pattern of expression in reproductive and cardiovascular tissues and, unexpectedly, is not expressed by liver. Since changes in heart function and remodeling of renal and uterine vasculature are amongst the earliest maternal responses to pregnancy, the product of the A2Mp gene has been postulated to systemically regulate these changes. A2Ms with and without non-covalently bound ligands also down regulate immune cell activation but promote immune cell migration, additional features associated with gestational success. Here, we review the A2M gene families of mice and humans, the predicted structural relationships between A2M and its pregnancy induced forms and the postulated roles for this gene family in normal pregnancy.	2005	Functions of alpha 2 macroglobulins in pregnancy.	16297527	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC9214531	10.1073/pnas.2119804119	Single-cell transcriptomics has revealed specific glial activation states associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. While these findings may eventually lead to new therapeutic opportunities, little is known about how these glial responses are reflected by biomarker changes in bodily fluids. Such knowledge, however, appears crucial for patient stratification, as well as monitoring disease progression and treatment responses in clinical trials. Here, we took advantage of well-described mouse models of β-amyloidosis and α-synucleinopathy to explore cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome changes related to their respective proteopathic lesions. Nontargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the majority of proteins that undergo age-related changes in CSF of either mouse model were linked to microglia and astrocytes. Specifically, we identified a panel of more than 20 glial-derived proteins that were increased in CSF of aged β-amyloid precursor protein- and α-synuclein-transgenic mice and largely overlap with previously described disease-associated glial genes identified by single-cell transcriptomics. Our results also show that enhanced shedding is responsible for the increase of several of the identified glial CSF proteins as exemplified for TREM2. Notably, the vast majority of these proteins can also be quantified in human CSF and reveal changes in Alzheimer’s disease cohorts. The finding that cellular transcriptome changes translate into corresponding changes of CSF proteins is of clinical relevance, supporting efforts to identify fluid biomarkers that reflect the various functional states of glial responses in cerebral proteopathies, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.	2022	Signatures of glial activity can be detected in the CSF proteome.	35666874	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
NA	10.1095/biolreprod.104.029835	Full-length cDNA for a mouse gene A2-macroglobulin induced by pregnancy (A2mp) was cloned from mesometrial decidua at Gestation Day 10. The 4622-base pair cDNA encodes a protein of 1473 AA with >70% sequence identity and all typical domains of other A2M-family members in humans and rodents, despite unique absence of hepatic expression. The bait region is most distinct and has the greatest sequence similarity with rat acute-phase A2m. Northern blotting, reverse transcription and real-time-PCR, and in situ hybridization studies using C57Bl/6 mice revealed uterine induction of A2mp during decidualization and strong, midgestational association with modifying spiral arteries. Ovaries, testes, lactating mammary glands, heart, and kidney were the only additional organs with A2mp expression that was localized to granulosa and cumulus cells in secondary follicles; primary seminiferous epithelium, including Sertoli cells, mammary alveolar, and ductal epithelium; cardiac endothelium; and renal collecting tubules, respectively. Infusion of native human A2M into pregnant alymphoid or interferon-gamma gene-ablated mice overcame blocks to pregnancy-induced spiral artery modification in these strains. Activated human A2M was also effective, suggesting mechanisms independent of proteinase inhibition. Identification of cytokines, growth factors, or other molecules bound to A2MP should provide new insights into decidualization, spiral artery modification, and cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy.	2005	Characterization of a murine alpha 2 macroglobulin gene expressed in reproductive and cardiovascular tissue.	15355875	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol

It is shown that there are a weak focus of multiplicity at most two and a cusp of codimension at most two for various parameter values, and the model undergoes saddle-node bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two, Hopf bifurcation, and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension two as the parameters vary. It is shown that there exists a critical value α=α0 for the psychological effect, and two critical values k=k0,k1(k0<k1) for the infection rate such that: (i) when α>α0 , or α≤α0 and k≤k0 , the disease will die out for all positive initial populations; (ii) when α=α0 and k0<k≤k1 , the disease will die out for almost all positive initial populations; (iii) when α=α0 and k>k1 , the disease will persist in the form of a positive coexistent steady state for some positive initial populations; and (iv) when α<α0 and k>k0 , the disease will persist in the form of multiple positive periodic coexistent oscillations and coexistent steady states for some positive initial populations. Numerical simulations, including the existence of one or two limit cycles and data-fitting of the influenza data in Mainland China, are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.	2019	Bifurcation analysis of an SIRS epidemic model with a generalized nonmonotone and saturated incidence rate.	32226129	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC2804868	10.1002/gepi.20294	Common diseases with a genetic basis are likely to have a very complex etiology, in which the mapping between genotype and phenotype is far from straightforward. A new comprehensive statistical and computational strategy for identifying the missing link between genotype and phenotype has been proposed, which emphasizes the need to address heterogeneity in the first stage of any analysis and gene-gene interactions in the second stage. We applied this two-stage analysis strategy to late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) data, which included functional and positional candidate genes and markers in a region of interest on chromosome 10. Bayesian classification found statistically significant clusterings for independent family-based and case-control datasets, which used the same five markers in leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 3 (LRRTM3) as the most influential in determining cluster assignment. In subsequent analyses to detect main effects and gene-gene interactions, markers in three genes--urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU), angiotensin 1 converting enzyme (ACE) and cell division cycle 2 (CDC2)--were found to be associated with LOAD in particular subsets of the data based on their LRRTM3 multilocus genotype. All of these genes are viable candidates for LOAD based on their known biological function, even though PLAU, CDC2 and LRRTM3 were initially identified as positional candidates. Further studies are needed to replicate these statistical findings and to elucidate possible biological interaction mechanisms between LRRTM3 and these genes.	2008	Confronting complexity in late-onset Alzheimer disease: application of two-stage analysis approach addressing heterogeneity and epistasis.	18076107	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC2967520	10.1530/rep.0.1260149	In primates, including women, and in rodents, natural killer lymphocytes (NK cells) have a unique relationship with the decidualizing uterus. Implantation sites from genetically modified and transplanted mice have proven useful models for understanding potential mechanisms involved in the recruitment, activation and functions of human CD56(bright) uterine (u)NK cells. Key findings are reviewed in this article. In mice, uNK precursor cells are recruited from secondary lymphoid tissues and are activated coincident with their uterine arrival. uNK cells proliferate, produce cytokines (interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 18 (IL-18) and IL-27), and terminally differentiate into granulated lymphocytes. Many uNK cells proliferate within the myometrium at each implantation site forming a structure, the mesometrial lymphoid aggregate of pregnancy (MLAp) that surrounds blood vessels servicing each placenta. Post-mitotic uNK cells are abundant within decidua basalis; frequently (<25%) associating with spiral arteries, intramurally and intraluminally. From mid-gestation, numbers of uNK cells decline. Studies of implantation sites in mice lacking uNK cells, IFN-gamma, components of IFN-gamma-induction and -signalling pathways or IFN-gamma-regulated genes indicate that uNK cell-derived IFN-gamma is essential in triggering pregnancy-induced spiral artery modification. Decidual maintenance and uNK cell death are additional effects of uNK cell-derived IFN-gamma. Thus, during the first half of gestation, uNK cells contribute to and sustain important changes in the maternal placental bed.	2003	Uterine natural killer cells: insights into their cellular and molecular biology from mouse modelling.	12887272	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol

Based on the infiltration of immune cells (Immune score), stromal cells (Stromal score), and tumor purity (Estimate score), the ""Estimate"" algorithm was used to construct 3 scores for each patient. To identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted using DAVID database and visualized using the R software. The STRING database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and functional modules. <i>FGD2</i> expression was confirmed via Western Blotting and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses.<h4>Results</h4>Patients with higher immune scores estimate scores showed better OS than those with lower scores. All three scores were related to age and primary tumor stage. Further, DEGs between patients with high immune/stromal scores and low immune/stromal scores were screened. Eventually, 10 down-regulated DEGs and 201 up-regulated DEGs were identified as TME associated genes. Out of these, the <i>FGD2</i> gene demonstrated close association with survival and was confirmed in the included melanoma patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, TME is closely associated with the prognosis of melanoma patients.

This study aimed to characterize the changes in the muscle secretome associated with cancer cachexia to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved and to identify secreted proteins which may reflect this wasting process. The changes in the muscle proteome of the C26 model were investigated by label-free proteomic analysis followed by a bioinformatic analysis in order to identify potentially secreted proteins. Multiple reaction monitoring and Western blotting were used to verify the presence of candidate proteins in the circulation. Our results revealed a marked increased muscular production of several acute phase reactants (APR: Haptoglobin, Serine protease inhibitor A3N, Complement C3, Serum amyloid A-1 protein) which are released in the circulation during C26 cancer cachexia. This was confirmed in other models of cancer cachexia as well as in cancer patients. Glucocorticoids and proinflammatory cytokines are responsible for an increased production of APR by muscle cells. Finally, their muscular expressions are strongly positively correlated with body weight loss as well as the muscular induction of atrogens. Our study demonstrates therefore a marked increased production of APR by the muscle in cancer cachexia.	2020	Marked Increased Production of Acute Phase Reactants by Skeletal Muscle during Cancer Cachexia. 	33142864	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC2821734	10.1002/ajmg.b.30899	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive dementia in the elderly. It is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the neuropathologic findings of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques that accumulate in vulnerable brain regions. AD etiology has been studied by many groups, but since the discovery of the APOE epsilon4 allele, no further genes have been mapped conclusively to late-onset AD (LOAD). In this study, we examined genetic association with LOAD susceptibility in 738 Caucasian families (4,704 individuals) and an independent case-control dataset with 296 cases and 566 controls exploring 11 candidate genes (47 SNPs common to both samples). In addition to tests for main effects and haplotypes, the MDR-PDT was used to search for gene-gene interactions in the family data. We observed significant haplotype effects in ACE in family and case-control samples using standard and cladistic haplotype models. ACE was also part of significant 2 and 3-locus MDR-PDT joint effects models with Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M), which mediates the clearance of Abeta, and Leucine-Rich Repeat Transmembrane-3 (LRRTM3), a nested gene in Alpha-3 Catenin (CTNNA3) which binds Presenilin-1. This result did not replicate in the case-control sample, and may not be a true positive. These genes are related to Abeta clearance; thus this constellation of effects might constitute an axis of susceptibility for LOAD. The consistent ACE haplotype result between independent family-based and unrelated case-control datasets is strong evidence in favor of ACE as a susceptibility locus for AD, and replicates results from several other studies in a large sample.	2009	An association analysis of Alzheimer disease candidate genes detects an ancestral risk haplotype clade in ACE and putative multilocus association between ACE, A2M, and LRRTM3.	19105203	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol

These killer cell lectin-like receptors (KLR) are involved in NK target cell recognition, leading to activation or inhibition of NK cell function. We used a number of sequence-tagged site (STS) markers from this region to screen two large insert bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries and a bacteriophage P1-derived (PAC) chromosome library. The clones were assembled into contiguous sets by STS content analysis. The 72-BAC and 11-PAC contig covers nearly 2 Mb of DNA and provides an average marker resolution of 26 kb. We have precisely localized 17 genes, 5 expressed sequence tags, and 49 STSs within this contig. Of this total number of STS, 30 are newly developed by clone-end sequencing. We established the order of the genes as tel-M6PR-MAFAL (HGMW-approved symbol KLRG1)-A2M-PZP-A2MP-NKRP1A (HGMW-approved symbol KLRB1)-CD69-AICL (HGMW-approved symbol CLECSF2)-KLRF1-OLR1-CD94 (HGMW-approved symbol KLRD1)-NKG2D (HGMW-approved symbol D12S2489E)-PGFL-NKG2F (HGMW-approved symbol KLRC4)-NKG2E (HGMW-approved symbol KLRC3)-NKG2A (HGMW-approved symbol KLRC1)-LY49L (HGMW-approved symbol KLRA1)-cen. This map would facilitate the cloning of new KLR genes and the complete sequencing of this region.	2000	A sequence-ready physical map of the region containing the human natural killer gene complex on chromosome 12p12.3-p13.2.	10783260	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC7292149	10.3389/fimmu.2020.01110	<b>Background:</b> MiR-146a is an important regulator of innate inflammatory responses and is also implicated in cell death and survival. <b>Methods:</b> By sorting CNS resident cells, microglia were the main cellular source of miR-146a. Therefore, we investigated microglia function and phenotype in miR-146a knock-out (KO) mice, analyzed the proteome of KO and wild-type (WT) microglia by LC-MS/MS, and examined miR-146a expression in different brain lesions of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). <b>Results:</b> When stimulated with LPS or myelin <i>in vitro</i>, microglia from KO mice expressed higher levels of IL-1β, TNF, IL-6, IL-10, CCL3, and CCL2 compared to WT. Stimulation increased migration and phagocytosis of WT but not KO microglia. CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia were induced by cuprizone (CPZ) in the WT mice but less in the KO. The proteome of <i>ex vivo</i> microglia was not different in miR-146a KO compared to WT mice, but CPZ treatment induced differential and reduced protein responses in the KO: GOT1, COX5b, CRYL1, and cystatin-C were specifically changed in KO microglia. We explored discriminative features of microglia proteomes: sparse Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis showed the best discrimination when control and CPZ-treated conditions were compared. Cluster of ten proteins separated WT and miR-146a KO microglia after CPZ: among them were sensomes allowing to perceive the environment, Atp1a3 that belongs to the signature of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia, and proteins related to inflammatory responses (S100A9, Ppm1g). Finally, we examined the expression of miR-146a and its validated target genes in different brain lesions of MS patients. MiR-146 was upregulated in all lesion types, and the highest expression was in active lesions. Nineteen of 88 validated target genes were significantly changed in active lesions, while none were changed in NAWM. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our data indicated that microglia is the major source of miR-146a in the CNS. The absence of miR-146a differentially affected microglia function and proteome, and miR-146a may play an important role in gene regulation of active MS lesions.	2020	Absence of miRNA-146a Differentially Alters Microglia Function and Proteome.	32582192	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC3340370	10.1371/journal.pone.0030144	The 3,000 oil/gas structures currently deployed in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) provide hard substratum for marine organisms in a region where such has been rare since the Holocene. The major exception to this are the Flower Garden Banks (FGB). Corals are known to have colonized oil/gas platforms around the FGB, facilitating biogeographic expansion. We ask the question, what are the patterns of genetic affinity in these coral populations. We sampled coral tissue from populations of two species occurring on oil and gas platforms: Madracis decactis (hermatype) and Tubastraea coccinea (invasive ahermatype). We sampled 28 platforms along four transects from 20 km offshore to the continental shelf edge off 1) Matagorda Island, TX; 2) Lake Sabine, TX; 3) Terrebonne Bay, LA; and 4) Mobile, AL. The entire population of M. decactis was sampled between depths of 5 m and 37 m. T. coccinea populations were sub-sampled. Genetic variation was assessed using the PCR-based Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). Data were analyzed via AFLPOP and STRUCTURE. Genetic connectivity among M. decactis platform populations was highest near the FGB and decreased to the east. Connectivity increased again in the eastern sector, indicating isolation between the populations from different sides of the Mississippi River (Transects 3 and 4). A point-drop in genetic affinity (relatedness) at the shelf edge south of Terrebonne Bay, LA indicated a population differing from all others in the northern GOM. Genetic affinities among T. coccinea were highest in the west and decreased to the east. Very low genetic affinities off Mobile, AL indicated a dramatic difference between those populations and those west of the Mississippi River, apparently a formidable barrier to larval dispersal.	2012	Genetic connectivity in scleractinian corals across the Northern Gulf of Mexico: oil/gas platforms, and relationship to the Flower Garden Banks.	22558066	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC5296798	10.1523/jneurosci.2267-16.2016	The mammalian inner ear (IE) subserves auditory and vestibular sensations via highly specialized cells and proteins. Sensory receptor hair cells (HCs) are necessary for transducing mechanical inputs and stimulating sensory neurons by using a host of known and as yet unknown protein machinery. To understand the protein composition of these unique postmitotic cells, in which irreversible protein degradation or damage can lead to impaired hearing and balance, we analyzed IE samples by tandem mass spectrometry to generate an unbiased, shotgun-proteomics view of protein identities and abundances. By using Pou4f3/eGFP-transgenic mice in which HCs express GFP driven by Pou4f3, we FACS purified a population of HCs to analyze and compare the HC proteome with other IE subproteomes from sensory epithelia and whole IE. We show that the mammalian HC proteome comprises hundreds of uniquely or highly expressed proteins. Our global proteomic analysis of purified HCs extends the existing HC transcriptome, revealing previously undetected gene products and isoform-specific protein expression. Comparison of our proteomic data with mouse and human databases of genetic auditory/vestibular impairments confirms the critical role of the HC proteome for normal IE function, providing a cell-specific pool of candidates for novel, important HC genes. Several proteins identified exclusively in HCs by proteomics and verified by immunohistochemistry map to human genetic deafness loci, potentially representing new deafness genes.<h4>Significance statement</h4>Hearing and balance rely on specialized sensory hair cells (HCs) in the inner ear (IE) to convey information about sound, acceleration, and orientation to the brain. Genetically and environmentally induced perturbations to HC proteins can result in deafness and severe imbalance. We used transgenic mice with GFP-expressing HCs, coupled with FACS sorting and tandem mass spectrometry, to define the most complete HC and IE proteome to date. We show that hundreds of proteins are uniquely identified or enriched in HCs, extending previous gene expression analyses to reveal novel HC proteins and isoforms. Importantly, deafness-linked proteins were significantly enriched in HCs, suggesting that this in-depth proteomic analysis of IE sensory cells may hold potential for deafness gene discovery.	2017	Global Analysis of Protein Expression of Inner Ear Hair Cells.	28039372	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol

To identify orchestrators of this regenerative response we have performed proteomic analyses of skin from Acomys and Mus musculus before and after wounding. Of the ~2000 proteins identified many are expressed at similar levels in Acomys and Mus, but there are significant differences. Following wounding in Mus the complement and coagulation cascades, PPAR signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interactions predominate. In Acomys, other pathways predominate including the Wnt, MAPK, the ribosome, proteasome, endocytosis and tight junction pathways. Notable among Acomys specific proteins are several ubiquitin-associated enzymes and kinases, whereas in Mus immuno-modulation proteins characteristic of inflammatory response are unique or more prominent. ECM proteins such as collagens are more highly expressed in Mus, but likely more important is the higher expression of matrix remodeling proteases in Acomys. Another distinctive difference between Acomys and Mus lies in the macrophage-produced arginase 1 is found in Mus whereas arginase 2 is found in Acomys. Thus, we have identified several avenues for experimental approaches whose aim is to reduce the fibrotic response that the typical mammal displays in response to wounding.	2020	Comparative Proteomic Analysis in Scar-Free Skin Regeneration in Acomys cahirinus and Scarring Mus musculus.	31932597	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC2980860	10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.03.025	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder with a clear genetic component. Three genes have been identified as the cause of early onset familial AD (EOAD). The most common form of the disease, late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), is, however, a sporadic one presenting itself in later stages of life. The genetic component of this late onset form of AD has been the target of a large number of studies, because only one genetic risk factor (APOE4) has been consistently associated with the disease. However, technological advances allow new approaches in the study of complex disorders. In this review, we discuss the new results produced by genome wide association studies, in light of the current knowledge of the complexity of AD genetics.	2012	The genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease: beyond APP, PSENs and APOE.	20594621	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC4538681	10.1073/pnas.1510111112	Compartmentalization and polarized protein trafficking are essential for many cellular functions. The photoreceptor outer segment (OS) is a sensory compartment specialized for phototransduction, and it shares many features with primary cilia. As expected, mutations disrupting protein trafficking to cilia often disrupt protein trafficking to the OS and cause photoreceptor degeneration. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is one of the ciliopathies associated with defective ciliary trafficking and photoreceptor degeneration. However, precise roles of BBS proteins in photoreceptor cells and the underlying mechanisms of photoreceptor degeneration in BBS are not well understood. Here, we show that accumulation of non-OS proteins in the OS underlies photoreceptor degeneration in BBS. Using a newly developed BBS mouse model [Leucine zipper transcription factor-like 1 (Lztfl1)/Bbs17 mutant], isolated OSs, and quantitative proteomics, we determined 138 proteins that are enriched more than threefold in BBS mutant OS. In contrast, only eight proteins showed a more than threefold reduction. We found striking accumulation of Stx3 and Stxbp1/Munc18-1 and loss of polarized localization of Prom1 within the Lztfl1 and Bbs1 mutant OS. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that large vesicles are formed in the BBS OS, disrupting the lamellar structure of the OS. Our findings suggest that accumulation (and consequent sequestration) of non-OS proteins in the OS is likely the primary cause of photoreceptor degeneration in BBS. Our data also suggest that a major function of BBS proteins in photoreceptors is to transport proteins from the OS to the cell body or to prevent entry of non-OS proteins into the OS.	2015	Accumulation of non-outer segment proteins in the outer segment underlies photoreceptor degeneration in Bardet-Biedl syndrome.	26216965	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC3110051	10.1038/ejhg.2011.22	Our specific aims were to evaluate the power of bivariate analysis and to compare its performance with traditional univariate analysis in samples of unrelated subjects under varying sampling selection designs. Bivariate association analysis was based on the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model that allows different genetic models for different traits. We conducted extensive simulations for the case of two correlated quantitative phenotypes, with the quantitative trait locus making equal or unequal contributions to each phenotype. Our simulation results confirmed that the power of bivariate analysis is affected by the size, direction and source of the phenotypic correlations between traits. They also showed that the optimal sampling scheme depends on the size and direction of the induced genetic correlation. In addition, we demonstrated the efficacy of SUR-based bivariate test by applying it to a real Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) values measured at the lumbar spine (LS) and at the femoral neck (FN) in a sample of unrelated males with low BMD (LS Z-scores ≤ -2) and with high BMD (LS and FN Z-scores >0.5). A substantial amount of top hits in bivariate analysis did not reach nominal significance in any of the two single-trait analyses. Altogether, our studies suggest that bivariate analysis is of practical significance for GWAS of correlated phenotypes.	2011	Bivariate association analysis in selected samples: application to a GWAS of two bone mineral density phenotypes in males with high or low BMD.	21427758	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol

Human genes are often named with a gene symbol and a longer, more descriptive term; the short form is very often an abbreviation of the long form. Abbreviations in biomedical language are highly ambiguous, i.e., one gene symbol often refers to more than one gene. Using an existing abbreviation expansion algorithm,we explore MEDLINE for the use of human gene symbols derived from LocusLink. It turns out that just over 40% of these symbols occur in MEDLINE, however, many of these occurrences are not related to genes.

PMC6179157	10.1002/ajmg.b.32499	Alzheimer's disease (AD) (MIM: 104300) is a highly heritable disease with great complexity in its genetic contributors, and represents the most common form of dementia. With the gradual aging of the world's population, leading to increased prevalence of AD, and the substantial cost of care for those afflicted, identifying the genetic causes of disease represents a critical effort in identifying therapeutic targets. Here we provide a comprehensive review of genomic studies of AD, from the earliest linkage studies identifying monogenic contributors to early-onset forms of AD to the genome-wide and rare variant association studies of recent years that are being used to characterize the mosaic of genetic contributors to late-onset AD (LOAD), and which have identified approximately ∼20 genes with common variants contributing to LOAD risk. In addition, we explore studies employing alternative approaches to identify genetic contributors to AD, including studies of AD-related phenotypes and multi-variant association studies such as pathway analyses. Finally, we introduce studies of next-generation sequencing, which have recently helped identify multiple low-frequency and rare variant contributors to AD, and discuss on-going efforts with next-generation sequencing studies to develop statistically well- powered and comprehensive genomic studies of AD. Through this review, we help uncover the many insights the genetics of AD have provided into the pathways and pathophysiology of AD. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	2017	Genomic variants, genes, and pathways of Alzheimer's disease: An overview.	27943641	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol
PMC1887148	NA	The alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) and its 39-kd receptor-associated protein (RAP) were identified by indirect immunofluorescence in human extravillous and villous trophoblast cells at different stages of pregnancy. The alpha 2MR/LRP was detected in invading trophoblast cells and in some instances these invading cells did not express RAP. In chorionic villi of first and second trimester placenta, alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP were found in cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast. With advancing pregnancy alpha 2MR/LRP became primarily localized to the apical surface of the syncytiotrophoblast, while RAP was present in the cytoplasm. Villous cytotrophoblast cells lost both proteins by the third trimester. Isolated cytotrophoblast cells that undergo spontaneous differentiation into syncytiotrophoblast in culture increased expression of both alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP. With syncytium formation, alpha 2MR/LRP became localized to the plasma membrane in cup-like structures. Changes in the mRNAs for alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP paralleled the changes in relative abundance of the proteins assessed by immunofluorescence. cAMP treatment suppressed both alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP in the cultured trophoblasts, but alpha 2MR/LRP was reduced to a greater extent than RAP. We conclude that alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP are developmentally regulated in human trophoblast cells, that the temporal and spatial patterns of expression of these proteins can be dissociated, and that cAMP modulates both alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP in human trophoblast. The patterns of alpha 2MR/LRP and RAP expression in trophoblast cells are consistent with roles for the receptor in trophoblast invasion and transport of molecules across the syncytiotrophoblast.	1994	Expression of alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and the 39-kd receptor-associated protein in human trophoblasts.	7508685	A2MP	A2MP1	secondary_symbol

The form of the profile, in addition to revealing a hitherto unreported proteinase-binding capability of alpha 2-macroglobulin (beta-sites), also indicates that saturation of alpha-sites corresponds to a molar binding ratio of alpha 2-macroglobulin/trypsin of 1:2.

We obtained human dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) samples from organ donors and performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the hDRG transcriptional landscape, systematically comparing it with publicly available data from a variety of human and orthologous mouse tissues, including mouse DRG (mDRG). We characterized the hDRG transcriptional profile in terms of tissue-restricted gene coexpression patterns and putative transcriptional regulators, and formulated an information-theoretic framework to quantify DRG enrichment. Relevant gene families and pathways were also analyzed, including transcription factors, G-protein-coupled receptors, and ion channels. Our analyses reveal an hDRG-enriched protein-coding gene set (∼140), some of which have not been described in the context of DRG or pain signaling. Most of these show conserved enrichment in mDRG and were mined for known drug-gene product interactions. Conserved enrichment of the vast majority of transcription factors suggests that the mDRG is a faithful model system for studying hDRG, because of evolutionarily conserved regulatory programs. Comparison of hDRG and tibial nerve transcriptomes suggests trafficking of neuronal mRNA to axons in adult hDRG, and are consistent with studies of axonal transport in rodent sensory neurons. We present our work as an online, searchable repository (https://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/painneurosciencelab/sensoryomics/drgtxome), creating a valuable resource for the community.

NA	10.5603/fm.a2016.0018	<h4>Background</h4>When closed by the superior transverse scapular ligament (STSL), the suprascapular notch (SSN) creates an osseo-fibrous tunnel which acts as a pathway for the suprascapular nerve (SN). Anatomical variations are common in this region, and these can increase the risk of neuropathy by restricting the space for nerve passage. The aim of this study is to identify any correlation between the area reduction coefficient parameters and the SN and vessel arrangements in the SSN region.<h4>Material and methods</h4>The SSN region was dissected in 88 formalin-fixed cadaveric shoulders (40 left and 48 right). During dissection, the topography of the SN, artery and vein was evaluated. Quantitative visual data analysis software was used to measure the areas of the STSL and the anterior coracoscapular ligament (ACSL), as well as the diameters of the SN and associated vessels, and to assign those structures to existing classifications. The area reduction coefficient (ARC) was calculated for each shoulder.<h4>Results</h4>The area of the STSL (aSTSL) and ACSL (aACSL) were significantly larger in Type IV than Type I of the triad. Similarly, the aSTSL and area of the SSN (aSSN) were found to be significantly larger in Type IV than Type III. However, no significant differences were found in the ARC of the STSL (ARCSTSL), the ARC of the ACSL (ARCACSL) or the total ARC (ARCtotal).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although the aSTSL, aACSL and aSSN varied according to the type of SN and vessel arrangement, coefficient analysis (ARCSTSL, ARCACSL and ARCtotal) indicated that combined effect of these variations did not significantly affect SSN morphology.	2016	A quantitative study of the arrangement of the suprascapular nerve and vessels in the suprascapular notch region: new findings based on parametric analysis.	27830880	AACSL	AACSP1	secondary_symbol

Morphological variations in the SSN region are common and can increase the risk of neuropathy by constricting the space for the nerve. The aim of this study was to establish new objective parameters that take this complex morphology into account.<h4>Methods</h4>The SSN region of 100 formalin-fixed cadaveric shoulders was dissected. The dimensions of the SSN, the STSL and the anterior coracoscapular ligament (ACSL), as well as diameters of the SN, associated vessels and SN passage area, were measured by means of quantitative visual data analysis software to assign those structures to present classifications. The area reduction coefficient (ARC) and the ambit occupation coefficient (AOC) were defined and calculated for each shoulder.<h4>Results</h4>The mean ARC and AOC for ligaments in the suprascapular region were: ARCSTSL = 71.6%, ARCACSL = 9.6%, AOCSTSL = 56.8% and AOCACSL = 9.1%. The SN passage area, ARC and AOC did not differ significantly between SSN types. The SN passage area and ARC differed significantly between band- and fan-shaped types of STSL. A significant relationship was observed between ARC and AOC (R=0.6855; p<0.0001). The SN passage area correlated significantly with ARC (R=-0.7555; p<0.0001) and AOC (R=-0.5609; p<0.0001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed parameters convey the complex morphology of the SSN region in a quantitative manner. The area reduction coefficient seems to be a more relevant indicator than the AOC as it better correlates with the SN passage area. Contrary to the SSN type, the STSL type significantly influences SN passage area and ARC.	2014	New parameters describing morphological variations in the suprascapular notch region as potential predictors of suprascapular nerve entrapment.	25424972	AACSL	AACSP1	secondary_symbol
PMC3591534	10.1007/s11307-012-0587-6	<h4>Purpose</h4>Abnormal fatty acid (FA) synthesis is one of the common features of cancer. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a multifunctional enzyme playing a key role in biosynthesis of FA, is up-regulated in prostate, breast, and lung carcinomas. Orlistat is a FDA-approved anti-obesity drug that inhibits the thioesterase domain of FASN, interferes with cellular FA synthesis, can arrest tumor cell proliferation, and induces tumor cell apoptosis. The current study was aimed to investigate the metabolic changes associated with FASN inhibition by orlistat and to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the observed metabolic changes in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines.<h4>Procedures</h4>Changes in metabolite pools in four NSCLC cell lines (H441, H1975, H3255, and PC14) with different mutational profiles were studied using NMR spectroscopy before and after in vitro incubation with sub-toxic concentration of orlistat and [1-(13)C]D-glucose or [1,2-(13)C2]choline. In vitro radiotracer accumulation assays in cells were performed with [(3)H]acetate, [(14)C]fluoroacetate, and 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose. In parallel, microarray profiling of genes involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was performed.<h4>Results</h4>In orlistat-treated NSCLC cells, FASN inhibition results in characteristic changes in intermediary metabolites (FAs, choline, phospholipids, and TCA cycle metabolites) as observed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further, FASN inhibition by orlistat induces multiple adaptive changes in FA synthetic pathway and associated metabolic pathways, including induction of ketone metabolism and glutaminolysis, as well as the up-regulation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These observed changes in metabolic pools in orlistat-treated cells demonstrate the critical role of fatty acid de novo synthesis and metabolism for cellular energy production, especially in tumor cells with low glycolytic activity, which goes beyond the widely accepted concept that FA synthesis is important for cell membrane biosynthesis in rapidly proliferating tumor cells.	2013	Metabolic shifts induced by fatty acid synthase inhibitor orlistat in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells provide novel pharmacodynamic biomarkers for positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.	22886728	AACSL	AACSP1	secondary_symbol

Individuals who present with TPP are thought to have an underlying genetic predisposition. Overactivation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase channel leads to large-scale intracellular shifts in potassium, leading to low serum levels and the clinical manifestations of TPP.

Additional genetic determinants should be detected so that a prediction model can be constructed.<h4>Objective</h4>To investigate the genetic architecture of TPP and distinguish TPP from Graves disease cohorts.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This population-based case-control study used a 2-stage genome-wide association study to investigate the risk loci of TPP and weighted genetic risk score to construct a TPP prediction model with data from a Chinese Han population recruited in hospitals in China from March 2003 to December 2015. The analysis was conducted from November 2014 to August 2016.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Loci specifically associated with TPP risk and those shared with Graves disease and prediction model of joint effects of TPP-specific loci.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 537 patients with TPP (mean [SD] age, 35 [11] years; 458 male) 1519 patients with Graves disease and no history of TPP (mean [SD] age, 38 [13] years; 366 male), and 3249 healthy participants (mean [SD] age, 46 [10] years; 1648 male) were recruited from the Han population by hospitals throughout China. Two new TPP-specific susceptibility loci were identified: DCHS2 on 4q31.3 (rs1352714: odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95% CI, 1.35-1.85; P = 1.24 × 10-8) and C11orf67 on 11q14.1 (rs2186564: OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.29-1.74; P = 2.80 × 10-7). One previously reported specific locus was confirmed on 17q24.3 near KCNJ2 (rs312729: OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.83-2.38; P = 8.02 × 10-29). Meanwhile, 2 risk loci (MHC and Xq21.1) were shared by Graves disease and TPP. After 2 years of treatment, the ratio of persistent thyrotropin receptor antibody positivity was higher in patients with TPP than in patients with Graves disease and no history of TPP (OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.04-7.16; P = 7.05 × 10-6). The prediction model using a weighted genetic risk score and 11 candidate TPP-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms had an area under the curve of 0.80.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>These findings provide evidence that TPP is a novel molecular subtype of Graves disease. The newly identified loci, along with other previously reported loci, demonstrate the growing complexity of the heritable contribution to TPP pathogenesis. A complete genetic architecture will be helpful to understand the pathophysiology of TPP, and a useful prediction model could prevent the onset of TPP.	2019	Assessment of Molecular Subtypes in Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis and Graves Disease Among Chinese Han Adults: A Population-Based Genome-Wide Association Study.	31050781	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC7909625	10.1371/journal.pone.0247757	Younger age at menarche (AAM) is associated with higher body mass index (BMI) for young women. Considering that continuous trends in decreasing AAM and increasing BMI are found in many countries, we attempted to assess whether the observed negative association between AAM and young adult BMI is causal. We included 4,093 women from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) and Healthy twin Study (HTS) with relevant epidemiologic data and genome-wide marker information. To mitigate the remarkable differences in AAM across generations, we converted the AAM to a generation-standardized AAM (gsAAM). To test causality, we applied the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, using a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 14 AAM-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We constructed MR models adjusting for education level and validated the results using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outliers test (MR-PRESSO), and MR-Egger regression methods. We found a null association using observed AAM and BMI level (conventional regression; -0.05 [95% CIs -0.10-0.00] per 1-year higher AAM). This null association was replicated when gsAAM was applied instead of AAM. Using the two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach employing a univariate GRS, the association was also negated for both AAM and gsAAM, regardless of model specifications. All the MR diagnostics suggested statistically insignificant associations, but weakly negative trends, without evidence of confounding from pleiotropy. We did not observe a causal association between AAM and young adult BMI whether we considered the birth cohort effect or not. Our study alone does not exclude the possibility of existing a weak negative association, considering the modest power of our study design.	2021	Causal relationship between the timing of menarche and young adult body mass index with consideration to a trend of consistently decreasing age at menarche.	33635908	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC5601665	10.18632/oncotarget.16997	Meningiomas are one of the most common tumors of the Central nervous system (CNS). This study aims to identify the autoantibody biomarkers in meningiomas using high-density human proteome arrays (~17,000 full-length recombinant human proteins). Screening of sera from 15 unaffected healthy individuals, 10 individuals with meningioma grade I and 5 with meningioma grade II was performed. This comprehensive proteomics based investigation revealed the dysregulation of 489 and 104 proteins in grades I and II of meningioma, respectively, along with the enrichment of several signalling pathways, which might play a crucial role in the manifestation of the disease. Autoantibody targets like IGHG4, CRYM, EFCAB2, STAT6, HDAC7A and CCNB1 were significantly dysregulated across both the grades. Further, we compared this to the tissue proteome and gene expression profile from GEO database. Previously reported upregulated proteins from meningioma tissue-based proteomics obtained from high-resolution mass spectrometry demonstrated an aggravated autoimmune response, emphasizing the clinical relevance of these targets. Some of these targets like SELENBP1 were tested for their presence in tumor tissue using immunoblotting. In the light of highly invasive diagnostic modalities employed to diagnose CNS tumors like meningioma, these autoantibody markers offer a minimally invasive diagnostic platform which could be pursued further for clinical translation.	2017	Evaluation of autoantibody signatures in meningioma patients using human proteome arrays.	28938569	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC6297388	10.3389/fnins.2018.00937	Teneurins are large transmembrane proteins originally identified in <i>Drosophila</i>. Their essential role in development of the central nervous system is conserved throughout species, and evidence supports their involvement in organogenesis of additional tissues. Homophilic and heterophilic interactions between Teneurin paralogues mediate cellular adhesion in crucial processes such as neuronal pathfinding and synaptic organization. At the molecular level, Teneurins are proteolytically processed into distinct subdomains that have been implicated in extracellular and intracellular signaling, and in transcriptional regulation. Phylogenetic studies have shown a high degree of intra- and interspecies conservation of Teneurin genes. Accordingly, the occurrence of genetic variants has been associated with functional and phenotypic alterations in experimental systems, and with some inherited or sporadic conditions. Recently, tumor-related variations in Teneurin gene expression have been associated with patient survival in different cancers. Although these findings were incidental and molecular mechanisms were not addressed, they suggested a potential utility of Teneurin transcript levels as biomarkers for disease prognosis. Mutations and chromosomal alterations affecting Teneurin genes have been found occasionally in tumors, but literature remains scarce. The analysis of open-access molecular and clinical datasets derived from large oncologic cohorts provides an invaluable resource for the identification of additional somatic mutations. However, Teneurin variants have not been classified in terms of pathogenic risk and their phenotypic impact remains unknown. On this basis, is it plausible to hypothesize that Teneurins play a role in carcinogenesis? Does current evidence support a tumor suppressive or rather oncogenic function for these proteins? Here, we comprehensively discuss available literature with integration of molecular evidence retrieved from open-access databases. We show that Teneurins undergo somatic changes comparable to those of well-established cancer genes, and discuss their involvement in cancer-related signaling pathways. Current data strongly suggest a functional contribution of Teneurins to human carcinogenesis.	2018	Teneurins: An Integrative Molecular, Functional, and Biomedical Overview of Their Role in Cancer.	30618566	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC6249231	10.1038/s41598-018-35102-2	Age-related decreases in olfactory sensitivity are often accompanied by a decrease in the quality of life. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are not well described. Inhaled substances including odorants are detected by sensory neurons in the olfactory cleft covered with a layer of mucus. This olfactory mucus is the first molecular machinery responsible for tissue protection and for detection of environmental odorants. Yet, little is known about the molecular identities of the actors because of the lack of information on the mucus proteome and its age-related changes. Here, we sampled human mucus from different nasal locations and from young and elderly subjects. The composition of the mucus was extensively analyzed by shotgun proteomic analysis for a vast array of proteins. We also explored correlations between the levels of each mucus proteins with the olfactory sensitivity of subjects. This analysis revealed previously unrecognized proteins with potentially important functions in olfaction. Taken together, this report describes the most comprehensive catalogue of the nasal mucus proteins to date, their positional and age-related differences, and candidate proteins associated with olfaction. This catalogue will provide fundamental information useful for future studies, such as identification of olfactory auxiliary proteins, causes of age-related declines in olfaction, and biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders.	2018	The human olfactory cleft mucus proteome and its age-related changes.	30464187	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC5763310	10.1186/s12920-017-0306-x	BACKGROUND:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has collected transcriptome, genome and epigenome information for over 20 cancers from thousands of patients. The availability of these diverse data types makes it necessary to combine these data to capture the heterogeneity of biological processes and phenotypes and further identify homogeneous subtypes for cancers such as breast cancer. Many multi-view clustering approaches are proposed to discover clusters across different data types. The problem is challenging when different data types show poor agreement of clustering structure. RESULTS:In this work, we first propose a multi-view clustering approach with consensus (CMC), which tries to find consensus kernels among views by using Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. To tackle the problem when poor agreement among views exists, we further propose a multi-view clustering approach with enhanced consensus (ECMC) to solve this problem by decomposing the kernel information in each view into a consensus part and a disagreement part. The consensus parts for different views are supposed to be similar, and the disagreement parts should be independent with the consensus parts. Both the CMC and ECMC models can be solved by alternative updating with semi-definite programming. Our experiments on both simulation datasets and real-world benchmark datasets show that ECMC model could achieve higher clustering accuracies than other state-of-art multi-view clustering approaches. We also apply the ECMC model to integrate mRNA expression, DNA methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression data for five cancer data sets, and the survival analysis show that our ECMC model outperforms other methods when identifying cancer subtypes. By Fisher's combination test method, we found that three computed subtypes roughly correspond to three known breast cancer subtypes including luminal B, HER2 and basal-like subtypes. CONCLUSION:Integrating heterogeneous TCGA datasets by our proposed multi-view clustering approach ECMC could effectively identify cancer subtypes.	2017	Subtype identification from heterogeneous TCGA datasets on a genomic scale by multi-view clustering with enhanced consensus.	29322925	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC7426966	10.1038/s41467-020-17697-1	A significant proportion of patients with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancers (BC) develop resistance to endocrine treatments (ET) and relapse with metastatic disease. Here we perform whole exome sequencing and gene expression analysis of matched primary breast tumours and bone metastasis-derived patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Transcriptomic analyses reveal enrichment of the G2/M checkpoint and up-regulation of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) in PDX. PLK1 inhibition results in tumour shrinkage in highly proliferating CCND1-driven PDX, including different RB-positive PDX with acquired palbociclib resistance. Mechanistic studies in endocrine resistant cell lines, suggest an ER-independent function of PLK1 in regulating cell proliferation. Finally, in two independent clinical cohorts of ER positive BC, we find a strong association between high expression of PLK1 and a shorter metastases-free survival and poor response to anastrozole. In conclusion, our findings support clinical development of PLK1 inhibitors in patients with advanced CCND1-driven BC, including patients progressing on palbociclib treatment.	2020	PLK1 inhibition exhibits strong anti-tumoral activity in CCND1-driven breast cancer metastases with acquired palbociclib resistance.	32792481	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC4288319	10.3389/fimmu.2014.00655	Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are expressed in cells but only a few have been well characterized. In these cases, lncRNAs have been shown to be key regulators of several cellular processes. Therefore, there is a great need to understand the function of more lncRNAs and their regulation in response to stimuli. Interferon (IFN) is a key molecule in the cellular antiviral response. IFN binding to its receptor activates transcription of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that function as potent antivirals. In addition, several ISGs are positive or negative regulators of the IFN pathway. This is essential to ensure a strong antiviral response and a later return of the cell to homeostasis. As the ISGs described to date are coding genes, we sought to determine whether IFN also regulates the expression of long non-coding ISGs. To this aim, we used RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of control and HuH7 cells treated with IFNα2. The results show that IFN-treatment regulates the expression of several unknown non-coding transcripts. We have validated two lncRNAs upregulated after treatment with different doses of type I IFNα2 in different cells or with type III IFNλ. These lncRNAs were also induced by influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus mutants unable to block the IFN response, but not by several wild-type lytic viruses tested. These lncRNA genes were named lncISG15 and lncBST2 as they are located close to ISGs ISG15 and BST2, respectively. Interestingly, inhibition experiments showed that lncBST2 is a positive regulator of BST2. Therefore lncBST2 has been renamed BISPR, from BST2 IFN-stimulated positive regulator. Our results may have therapeutic implications as lncBST2/BISPR, but also lncISG15 and their coding neighbors, are increased in cells infected with hepatitis C virus and in the liver of infected patients. These results allow us to hypothesize that several lncRNAs could be activated by IFN to control the potency of the antiviral IFN response.	2014	Long Non-Coding RNA BST2/BISPR is Induced by IFN and Regulates the Expression of the Antiviral Factor Tetherin.	25620967	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol

We applied multiexposure linear mixed-effects regressions with participant-level random intercept to identify significant Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in relation to 1-y average aircraft, railway, and road traffic day-evening-night noise (Lden); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter <2.5μm (PM2.5). We performed candidate (CpG-based; cross-systemic phenotypes, combined into ""allostatic load"") and agnostic (DMR-based) pathway enrichment tests, and replicated previously reported air pollution EWAS signals.<h4>Results</h4>We found no statistically significant CpGs at false discovery rate <0.05. However, 14, 48, 183, 8, and 71 DMRs independently associated with aircraft, railway, and road traffic Lden; NO2; and PM2.5, respectively, with minimally overlapping signals. Transportation Lden and air pollutants tendentially associated with decreased and increased methylation, respectively. We observed significant enrichment of candidate DNA methylation related to C-reactive protein and body mass index (aircraft, road traffic Lden, and PM2.5), renal function and ""allostatic load"" (all exposures). Agnostic functional networks related to cellular immunity, gene expression, cell growth/proliferation, cardiovascular, auditory, embryonic, and neurological systems development were enriched. We replicated increased methylation in cg08500171 (NO2) and decreased methylation in cg17629796 (PM2.5).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Mutually independent DNA methylation was associated with source-specific transportation noise and air pollution exposures, with distinct and shared enrichments for pathways related to inflammation, cellular development, and immune responses.

PMC6469281	10.1177/1176935119842573	The genome-wide identification of mutated genes is an important advance in our understanding of tumor biology, but several fundamental questions remain open. How do these genes act together to promote cancer development and, a related question, how are they spatially arranged in the nucleus to allow coordinated expression? We examined the nuclear topography of mutated genes in breast cancer and their relation to chromosome territories (CTs). We performed a literature review and analyzed 1 type of mutation, interchromosomal translocations, in 1546 primary breast cancers to infer the spatial arrangement of chromosomes. The cosegregation of all observed fusion genes was used to create a matrix of genome-wide CT contacts and develop a tentative CT map of breast cancer. Regression analysis was performed to determine the association between CTs and all types of mutations. Chromosomes 17, 11, 8, and 1 had the majority of interchromosomal fusions and are presumably clustered in the nuclear center, whereas chromosomes 22, 21, X, and 18 had the lowest number of contacts, likely reflecting a more peripheral position. Regression analysis revealed that there was no significant association between chromosome length indicated by the number of base pairs per chromosome and the number of total (inter- and intrachromosomal) translocations, point mutations, or copy number aberrations (CNAs). The gene density of chromosomes (genes/Mb) was significantly correlated with total translocations (<i>P</i> = .02), but not with point mutations <i>P</i> = .19 and CNAs <i>P</i> = .62. Finally, the association of the 3 genetic alterations with the CT map deduced from the interchromosomal fusions was significant, ie, total translocations <i>P</i> = 7 × 10<sup>-11</sup>, point mutations <i>P</i> = .01, CNAs <i>P</i> = .002. In conclusion, we developed a tentative CT map and observed a spatial association with genetic alterations in breast cancer.	2019	Interchromosomal Translocations as a Means to Map Chromosome Territories in Breast Cancer.	31019364	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC3970970	10.1038/onc.2013.202	Poor-prognosis oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is characterised by the presence of high-level focal amplifications. We utilised a focused small interfering RNA screen in 14 breast cancer cell lines to define genes that were pathogenic in three genomic regions focally amplified in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, 8p11-12, 11q13 and 20q. Silencing the GNAS locus, that encodes the G protein alpha stimulatory subunit Gαs, specifically reduced the growth of 20q amplified breast cancer cell lines. Examination of a publically available small hairpin RNA data set confirmed GNAS silencing to be selective for 20q amplified cancer cell lines. Cell lines with 20q amplification were found to overexpress specifically the extra long Gαs splice variant (XLαs). Overexpression of XLαs induced cAMP levels to a greater extent than Gαs, suggesting that amplification of the GNAS locus, and overexpression of the XLαs variant in particular, enhanced cAMP signalling. GNAS silencing in amplified cell lines reduced extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, and conversely overexpression of exogenous XLαs in a non-amplified cell line increased MEK-ERK1/2 phosphorylation, identifying one potential downstream consequence of enhanced cAMP signalling. Our data indicate that amplification of the GNAS locus may contribute to the pathogenesis of breast cancer, and highlight a previously unrecognised role for the GNAS XLαs variant in cancer.	2014	An siRNA screen identifies the GNAS locus as a driver in 20q amplified breast cancer. 	23752180	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC5201094	10.1182/blood-2016-05-715094	CD37 (tetraspanin TSPAN26) is a B-cell surface antigen widely expressed on mature B cells. CD37 is involved in immune regulation and tumor suppression but its function has not been fully elucidated. We assessed CD37 expression in de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and investigated its clinical and biologic significance in 773 patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) and 231 patients treated with CHOP. We found that CD37 loss (CD37<sup>-</sup>) in ∼60% of DLBCL patients showed significantly decreased survival after R-CHOP treatment, independent of the International Prognostic Index (IPI), germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)/activated B-cell-like (ABC) cell of origin, nodal/extranodal primary origin, and the prognostic factors associated with CD37<sup>-</sup>, including TP53 mutation, NF-κB<sup>high</sup>, Myc<sup>high</sup>, phosphorylated STAT3<sup>high</sup>, survivin<sup>high</sup>, p63<sup>-</sup>, and BCL6 translocation. CD37 positivity predicted superior survival, abolishing the prognostic impact of high IPI and above biomarkers in GCB-DLBCL but not in ABC-DLBCL. Combining risk scores for CD37<sup>-</sup> status and ABC cell of origin with the IPI, defined as molecularly adjusted IPI for R-CHOP (M-IPI-R), or IPI plus immunohistochemistry (IHC; IPI+IHC) for CD37, Myc, and Bcl-2, significantly improved risk prediction over IPI alone. Gene expression profiling suggested that decreased CD20 and increased PD-1 levels in CD37<sup>-</sup> DLBCL, ICOSLG upregulation in CD37<sup>+</sup> GCB-DLBCL, and CD37 functions during R-CHOP treatment underlie the pivotal role of CD37 status in clinical outcomes. In conclusion, CD37 is a critical determinant of R-CHOP outcome in DLBCL especially in GCB-DLBCL, representing its importance for optimal rituximab action and sustained immune responses. The combined molecular and clinical prognostic indices, M-IPI-R and IPI+IHC, have remarkable predictive values in R-CHOP-treated DLBCL.	2016	Assessment of CD37 B-cell antigen and cell of origin significantly improves risk prediction in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	27760757	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC3590990	10.1038/emboj.2013.19	Breast cancer is a group of heterogeneous diseases that show substantial variation in their molecular and clinical characteristics. This heterogeneity poses significant challenges not only in breast cancer management, but also in studying the biology of the disease. Recently, rapid progress has been made in understanding the genomic diversity of breast cancer. These advances led to the characterisation of a new genome-driven integrated classification of breast cancer, which substantially refines the existing classification systems currently used. The novel classification integrates molecular information on the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of breast cancer to define 10 integrative clusters, each associated with distinct clinical outcomes and providing new insights into the underlying biology and potential molecular drivers. These findings have profound implications both for the individualisation of treatment approaches, bringing us a step closer to the realisation of personalised cancer management in breast cancer, but also provide a new framework for studying the underlying biology of each novel subtype.	2013	A new genome-driven integrated classification of breast cancer and its implications.	23395906	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC3828332	10.1371/journal.pone.0079118	More and more transcription factors and their motifs have been reported and linked to specific gene expression levels. However, focusing only on transcription is not sufficient for mechanism research. Most genes, especially in eukaryotes, are alternatively spliced to different isoforms. Some of these isoforms increase the biodiversity of proteins. From this viewpoint, transcription and splicing are two of important mechanisms to modulate expression levels of isoforms. To integrate these two kinds of regulation, we built a linear regression model to select a subset of transcription factors and splicing factors for each co-expressed isoforms using least-angle regression approach. Then, we applied this method to investigate the mechanism of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a precursor lesion of acute myeloid leukemia. Results suggested that expression levels of most isoforms were regulated by a set of selected regulatory factors. Some of the detected factors, such as EGR1 and STAT family, are highly correlated with progression of MDS. We discovered that the splicing factor SRSF11 experienced alternative splicing switch, and in turn induced different amino acid sequences between MDS and controls. This splicing switch causes two different splicing mechanisms. Polymerase Chain Reaction experiments also confirmed that one of its isoforms was over-expressed in MDS. We analyzed the regulatory networks constructed from the co-expressed isoforms and their regulatory factors in MDS. Many of these networks were enriched in the herpes simplex infection pathway which involves many splicing factors, and pathways in cancers and acute or chronic myeloid leukemia.	2013	Discovering transcription and splicing networks in myelodysplastic syndromes.	24244432	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC3440846	10.1038/nature10983	The elucidation of breast cancer subgroups and their molecular drivers requires integrated views of the genome and transcriptome from representative numbers of patients. We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in ~40% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting CNAs. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA–RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘CNA-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome.	2012	The genomic and transcriptomic architecture of 2,000 breast tumours reveals novel subgroups.	22522925	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol

In this study, we reanalyzed data from seven independent data sets with totally 1079 breast cancer patients. The patients were treated with three different types of commonly used neoadjuvant chemotherapies: anthracycline alone, anthracycline plus paclitaxel, and anthracycline plus docetaxel. We developed random forest models with variable selection using both genetic and clinical variables to predict the response of a patient using pCR (pathological complete response) as the measure of response. The models were then used to reassign an optimal regimen to each patient to maximize the chance of pCR. An independent validation was performed where each independent study was left out during model building and later used for validation. The expected pCR rates of our method are significantly higher than the rates of the best treatments for all the seven independent studies. A validation study on 21 breast cancer cell lines showed that our prediction agrees with their drug-sensitivity profiles. In conclusion, the new strategy, called PRES (Personalized REgimen Selection), may significantly increase response rates for breast cancer patients, especially those with HER2 and ER negative tumors, who will receive one of the widely-accepted chemotherapy regimens.	2017	Personalized chemotherapy selection for breast cancer using gene expression profiles.	28256629	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol

Although DNA factors are integrated during some reprogramming methods, it is unknown whether the genome remains unchanged at the single nucleotide level. Here we show that 22 human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell lines reprogrammed using five different methods each contained an average of five protein-coding point mutations in the regions sampled (an estimated six protein-coding point mutations per exome). The majority of these mutations were non-synonymous, nonsense or splice variants, and were enriched in genes mutated or having causative effects in cancers. At least half of these reprogramming-associated mutations pre-existed in fibroblast progenitors at low frequencies, whereas the rest occurred during or after reprogramming. Thus, hiPS cells acquire genetic modifications in addition to epigenetic modifications. Extensive genetic screening should become a standard procedure to ensure hiPS cell safety before clinical use.	2011	Somatic coding mutations in human induced pluripotent stem cells.	21368825	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol

To filter the tumor specific antigen markers of NPC, sera from 42 healthy volunteers, 27 non-LNM NPC patients and 37 LNM NPC patients were selected for screening study using 2D combined with MS. Pretreatment strategy, including sonication, albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) depletion, was adopted for screening differentially expressed proteins of low abundance in serum. By 2D image analysis and MALDI-TOF-MS identification, twenty-three protein spots were differentially expressed. Three of them were further validated in the sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our research demonstrates that HSP70, sICAM-1 and SAA, confirmed with ELISA at sera and immunohistochemistry, are potential NPC metastasis-specific serum biomarkers which may be of great underlying significance in clinical detection and management of NPC.	2008	Serum proteome analysis for profiling protein markers associated with carcinogenesis and lymph node metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.	18357507	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC2702084	10.1371/journal.pone.0006146	<h4>Background</h4>Breast cancer cell lines have been used widely to investigate breast cancer pathobiology and new therapies. Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, and it is important to understand how well and which cell lines best model that diversity. In particular, microarray studies have identified molecular subtypes-luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2-associated, basal-like and normal-like-with characteristic gene-expression patterns and underlying DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). Here, we studied a collection of breast cancer cell lines to catalog molecular profiles and to assess their relation to breast cancer subtypes.<h4>Methods</h4>Whole-genome DNA microarrays were used to profile gene expression and CNAs in a collection of 52 widely-used breast cancer cell lines, and comparisons were made to existing profiles of primary breast tumors. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify gene-expression subtypes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to discover biological features of those subtypes. Genomic and transcriptional profiles were integrated to discover within high-amplitude CNAs candidate cancer genes with coordinately altered gene copy number and expression.<h4>Findings</h4>Transcriptional profiling of breast cancer cell lines identified one luminal and two basal-like (A and B) subtypes. Luminal lines displayed an estrogen receptor (ER) signature and resembled luminal-A/B tumors, basal-A lines were associated with ETS-pathway and BRCA1 signatures and resembled basal-like tumors, and basal-B lines displayed mesenchymal and stem/progenitor-cell characteristics. Compared to tumors, cell lines exhibited similar patterns of CNA, but an overall higher complexity of CNA (genetically simple luminal-A tumors were not represented), and only partial conservation of subtype-specific CNAs. We identified 80 high-level DNA amplifications and 13 multi-copy deletions, and the resident genes with concomitantly altered gene-expression, highlighting known and novel candidate breast cancer genes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, breast cancer cell lines were genetically more complex than tumors, but retained expression patterns with relevance to the luminal-basal subtype distinction. The compendium of molecular profiles defines cell lines suitable for investigations of subtype-specific pathobiology, cancer stem cell biology, biomarkers and therapies, and provides a resource for discovery of new breast cancer genes.	2009	Molecular profiling of breast cancer cell lines defines relevant tumor models and provides a resource for cancer gene discovery.	19582160	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC2644345	10.1158/0008-5472.can-08-3602	The chromosome 11q13.5 locus is frequently amplified in several types of human cancer. We have previously shown that 11q13.5 amplification was associated with significantly shorter overall survival in ovarian cancer patients, but the molecular mechanisms of how amplification of this locus contributes to disease aggressiveness remain unclear. Because ovarian cancer mortality is primarily related to resistance of chemotherapeutic agents, we screened the top six candidate genes within this amplicon for their contribution to drug resistance. Rsf-1 (also known as HBXAP) was found to be the only gene in which gene knockdown sensitized tumor cells to paclitaxel. Rsf-1 has been known to interact with hSNF2H to form an ISWI chromatin remodeling complex. We found that Rsf-1 was up-regulated in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, and Rsf-1 immunoreactivity in primary ovarian carcinoma tissues correlated with in vitro paclitaxel resistance. Ectopic expression of Rsf-1 significantly enhanced paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Down-regulation of hSNF2H or disruption of hSNF2H and Rsf-1 interaction enhanced paclitaxel sensitivity in tumor cells with Rsf-1 up-regulation. Rsf-1 expression altered expression in several genes and activated certain signaling pathways that may contribute to drug resistance. In conclusion, our results suggest that Rsf-1 is the major gene within the 11q13.5 amplicon that contributes to paclitaxel resistance, and the formation of the Rsf-1/hSNF2H complex is required for inducing this phenotype.	2009	Functional analysis of 11q13.5 amplicon identifies Rsf-1 (HBXAP) as a gene involved in paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer.	19190325	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol

Recent sequencing efforts have shown mutations in BRG1 (SMARCA4), one of two mutually exclusive ATPase subunits in the complex, in a significant number of human lung tumor cell lines and primary non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) clinical specimens. To determine how BRG1 loss fuels tumor progression in NSCLC, molecular profiling was performed after restoration of BRG1 expression or treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor or a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor in a BRG1-deficient NSCLC cells. Importantly, validation studies from multiple cell lines revealed that BRG1 reexpression led to substantial changes in the expression of CDH1, CDH3, EHF, and RRAD that commonly undergo silencing by other epigenetic mechanisms during NSCLC development. Furthermore, treatment with DNMT inhibitors did not restore expression of these transcripts, indicating that this common mechanism of gene silencing did not account for their loss of expression. Collectively, BRG1 loss is an important mechanism for the epigenetic silencing of target genes during NSCLC development.<h4>Implications</h4>Inactivation of the SWI/SNF complex provides a novel mechanism to induce gene silencing during NSCLC development.	2014	Gene silencing associated with SWI/SNF complex loss during NSCLC development.	24445599	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC3085564	10.1038/modpathol.2010.230	On the basis of digital karyotyping, we have identified a new, discrete amplified region at ch19p13.2 in a high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma. To further characterize this region, we determined the frequency and biological significance of ch19p13.2 amplification by analyzing 341 high-grade serous carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found an increased DNA copy number at this locus in 18% of cases. We correlated the DNA and RNA copy number by analyzing the TCGA data set for all amplified genes and detected seven genes within ch19p13.2 that were significantly correlated (R≥0.54) and were, in fact, listed as the top 100 potential 'driver' genes at a genome-wide scale. Interestingly, one of the seven genes, NACC1, encoding NAC1 was previously reported to be involved in the development of tumor recurrence in ovarian serous carcinoma and to have a causal role in the development of paclitaxel resistance. Therefore, we selected NACC1 for validation in an independent cohort. On the basis of fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that 35 (20%) of 175 high-grade serous carcinomas had an increased DNA copy number at the NACC1 locus, and those amplified cases were associated with early disease recurrence within 6 months (P=0.013). A significantly high level of NAC1 protein expression based on immunohistochemistry was detected in amplified tumors as compared with non-amplified tumors (P<0.005). In summary, our data suggest that amplification at the ch19p13.2 NACC1 locus, leading to NAC1 overexpression, is one of the molecular genetic alterations associated with early tumor recurrence in ovarian cancer.	2011	Amplification of the ch19p13.2 NACC1 locus in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma.	21240255	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC6139298	10.1016/j.envint.2017.08.006	Long-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with several adverse health effects including cardiovascular, respiratory diseases and cancers. However, underlying molecular alterations remain to be further investigated. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of long-term exposure to air pollutants on (a) average DNA methylation at functional regions and, (b) individual differentially methylated CpG sites. An assumption is that omic measurements, including the methylome, are more sensitive to low doses than hard health outcomes. This study included blood-derived DNA methylation (Illumina-HM450 methylation) for 454 Italian and 159 Dutch participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Long-term air pollution exposure levels, including NO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>coarse</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5 absorbance</sub> (soot) were estimated using models developed within the ESCAPE project, and back-extrapolated to the time of sampling when possible. We meta-analysed the associations between the air pollutants and global DNA methylation, methylation in functional regions and epigenome-wide methylation. CpG sites found differentially methylated with air pollution were further investigated for functional interpretation in an independent population (EnviroGenoMarkers project), where (N=613) participants had both methylation and gene expression data available. Exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with a significant global somatic hypomethylation (p-value=0.014). Hypomethylation of CpG island's shores and shelves and gene bodies was significantly associated with higher exposures to NO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>. Meta-analysing the epigenome-wide findings of the 2 cohorts did not show genome-wide significant associations at single CpG site level. However, several significant CpG were found if the analyses were separated by countries. By regressing gene expression levels against methylation levels of the exposure-related CpG sites, we identified several significant CpG-transcript pairs and highlighted 5 enriched pathways for NO<sub>2</sub> and 9 for NO<sub>x</sub> mainly related to the immune system and its regulation. Our findings support results on global hypomethylation associated with air pollution, and suggest that the shores and shelves of CpG islands and gene bodies are mostly affected by higher exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>. Functional differences in the immune system were suggested by transcriptome analyses.	2017	DNA methylation and exposure to ambient air pollution in two prospective cohorts.	28843141	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC3914808	10.1371/journal.pone.0087113	Liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma, but little is known about the genomic basis of this disease. Given the low cell content of this tumor type, we utilized flow cytometry to isolate the diploid normal and aneuploid tumor populations from a well-differentiated liposarcoma prior to array comparative genomic hybridization and whole genome sequencing. This work revealed massive highly focal amplifications throughout the aneuploid tumor genome including MDM2, a gene that has previously been found to be amplified in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Structural analysis revealed massive rearrangement of chromosome 12 and 11 gene fusions, some of which may be part of double minute chromosomes commonly present in well-differentiated liposarcoma. We identified a hotspot of genomic instability localized to a region of chromosome 12 that includes a highly conserved, putative L1 retrotransposon element, LOC100507498 which resides within a gene cluster (NAV3, SYT1, PAWR) where 6 of the 11 fusion events occurred. Interestingly, a potential gene fusion was also identified in amplified DDR2, which is a potential therapeutic target of kinase inhibitors such as dastinib, that are not routinely used in the treatment of patients with liposarcoma. Furthermore, 7 somatic, damaging single nucleotide variants have also been identified, including D125N in the PTPRQ protein. In conclusion, this work is the first to report the entire genome of a well-differentiated liposarcoma with novel chromosomal rearrangements associated with amplification of therapeutically targetable genes such as MDM2 and DDR2.	2014	Whole genome analyses of a well-differentiated liposarcoma reveals novel SYT1 and DDR2 rearrangements.	24505276	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC4522592	10.1016/j.redox.2015.06.020	Isoniazid is used either alone or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis. It is also used for the prevention of tuberculosis. Chronic treatment of Isoniazid may cause severe liver damage leading to acute liver failure. The mechanism through which Isoniazid causes liver damage is investigated. Isoniazid treatment generates reactive oxygen species and induces apoptosis in Hep3B cells. It induces antioxidative and apoptotic genes leading to increase in mRNA expression and protein levels in Hep3B cells. Whole genome expression analysis of Hep3B cells treated with Isoniazid has resulted in differential expression of various genes playing prime role in regulation of apoptotic, antioxidative, DNA damage, cell signaling, cell proliferation and differentiation pathways. Isoniazid increased cytosolic Nrf2 protein level while decreased nuclear Nrf2 protein level. It also decreased ERK1 phosphorylation and treatment of Hep3B cells with ERK inhibitor followed by Isoniazid resulting in increased apoptosis in these cells. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis results have also shown differential expression of various protein species including heat shock proteins, proteins playing important role in oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation. Results suggest that Isoniazid induces apoptosis through oxidative stress and also prevents Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus by reducing ERK1 phosphorylation thus preventing cytoprotective effect.	2015	Isoniazid prevents Nrf2 translocation by inhibiting ERK1 phosphorylation and induces oxidative stress and apoptosis.	26202867	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC2722962	10.1038/onc.2009.34	Co-amplification at chromosomes 8p11-8p12 and 11q12-11q14 occurs often in breast tumors, suggesting possible cooperation between genes in these regions in oncogenesis. We used high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) to map the minimal amplified regions. The 8p and 11q amplicons are complex and consist of at least four amplicon cores at each site. Candidate oncogenes mapping to these regions were identified by combining copy number and RNA and protein expression analyses. These studies also suggested that CCND1 at 11q13 induced expression of ZNF703 mapping at 8p12, which was subsequently shown to be mediated by the Rb/E2F pathway. Nine candidate oncogenes from 8p12 and four from 11q13 were further evaluated for oncogenic function. None of the genes individually promoted colony formation in soft agar or collaborated with each other functionally. On the other hand, FGFR1 and DDHD2 at 8p12 cooperated functionally with MYC, whereas CCND1 and ZNF703 cooperated with a dominant negative form of TP53. These observations highlight the complexity and functional consequences of the genomic rearrangements that occur in these breast cancer amplicons, including transcriptional cross-talk between genes in the 8p and 11q amplicons, as well as their cooperation with major pathways of tumorigenesis.	2009	Co-amplified genes at 8p12 and 11q13 in breast tumors cooperate with two major pathways in oncogenesis.	19330026	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC3098195	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001138	Gene fusions created by somatic genomic rearrangements are known to play an important role in the onset and development of some cancers, such as lymphomas and sarcomas. RNA-Seq (whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing) is proving to be a useful tool for the discovery of novel gene fusions in cancer transcriptomes. However, algorithmic methods for the discovery of gene fusions using RNA-Seq data remain underdeveloped. We have developed deFuse, a novel computational method for fusion discovery in tumor RNA-Seq data. Unlike existing methods that use only unique best-hit alignments and consider only fusion boundaries at the ends of known exons, deFuse considers all alignments and all possible locations for fusion boundaries. As a result, deFuse is able to identify fusion sequences with demonstrably better sensitivity than previous approaches. To increase the specificity of our approach, we curated a list of 60 true positive and 61 true negative fusion sequences (as confirmed by RT-PCR), and have trained an adaboost classifier on 11 novel features of the sequence data. The resulting classifier has an estimated value of 0.91 for the area under the ROC curve. We have used deFuse to discover gene fusions in 40 ovarian tumor samples, one ovarian cancer cell line, and three sarcoma samples. We report herein the first gene fusions discovered in ovarian cancer. We conclude that gene fusions are not infrequent events in ovarian cancer and that these events have the potential to substantially alter the expression patterns of the genes involved; gene fusions should therefore be considered in efforts to comprehensively characterize the mutational profiles of ovarian cancer transcriptomes.	2011	deFuse: an algorithm for gene fusion discovery in tumor RNA-Seq data.	21625565	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol
PMC3176258	10.1186/1471-2164-12-399	<h4>Background</h4>Allergic contact dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease that affects a significant proportion of the population. This disease is caused by an adverse immune response towards chemical haptens, and leads to a substantial economic burden for society. Current test of sensitizing chemicals rely on animal experimentation. New legislations on the registration and use of chemicals within pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries have stimulated significant research efforts to develop alternative, human cell-based assays for the prediction of sensitization. The aim is to replace animal experiments with in vitro tests displaying a higher predictive power.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a novel cell-based assay for the prediction of sensitizing chemicals. By analyzing the transcriptome of the human cell line MUTZ-3 after 24 h stimulation, using 20 different sensitizing chemicals, 20 non-sensitizing chemicals and vehicle controls, we have identified a biomarker signature of 200 genes with potent discriminatory ability. Using a Support Vector Machine for supervised classification, the prediction performance of the assay revealed an area under the ROC curve of 0.98. In addition, categorizing the chemicals according to the LLNA assay, this gene signature could also predict sensitizing potency. The identified markers are involved in biological pathways with immunological relevant functions, which can shed light on the process of human sensitization.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A gene signature predicting sensitization, using a human cell line in vitro, has been identified. This simple and robust cell-based assay has the potential to completely replace or drastically reduce the utilization of test systems based on experimental animals. Being based on human biology, the assay is proposed to be more accurate for predicting sensitization in humans, than the traditional animal-based tests.	2011	A genomic biomarker signature can predict skin sensitizers using a cell-based in vitro alternative to animal tests.	21824406	C11orf67	AAMDC	secondary_symbol

A new porcine Affymetrix expression array was designed in order to provide comprehensive coverage of the known pig transcriptome. The new array was used to generate a genome-wide expression atlas of pig tissues derived from 62 tissue/cell types. These data were subjected to network correlation analysis and clustering.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis presented here provides a detailed functional clustering of the pig transcriptome where transcripts are grouped according to their expression pattern, so one can infer the function of an uncharacterized gene from the company it keeps and the locations in which it is expressed. We describe the overall transcriptional signatures present in the tissue atlas, where possible assigning those signatures to specific cell populations or pathways. In particular, we discuss the expression signatures associated with the gastrointestinal tract, an organ that was sampled at 15 sites along its length and whose biology in the pig is similar to human. We identify sets of genes that define specialized cellular compartments and region-specific digestive functions. Finally, we performed a network analysis of the transcription factors expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and demonstrate how they sub-divide into functional groups that may control cellular gastrointestinal development.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As an important livestock animal with a physiology that is more similar than mouse to man, we provide a major new resource for understanding gene expression with respect to the known physiology of mammalian tissues and cells.

PMC9629490	10.1107/s2059798322009755	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs) represent the main subunits of the spliceosome. While the assembly of the snRNP core particles has been well characterized, comparably little is known of the incorporation of snRNP-specific proteins and the mechanisms of snRNP recycling. U5 snRNP assembly in yeast requires binding of the the Aar2 protein to Prp8p as a placeholder to preclude premature assembly of the SNRNP200 helicase, but the role of the human AAR2 homolog has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, a crystal structure of human AAR2 in complex with the RNase H-like domain of the U5-specific PRPF8 (PRP8F RH) is reported, revealing a significantly different interaction between the two proteins compared with that in yeast. Based on the structure of the AAR2-PRPF8 RH complex, the importance of the interacting regions and residues was probed and AAR2 variants were designed that failed to stably bind PRPF8 in vitro. Protein-interaction studies of AAR2 with U5 proteins using size-exclusion chromatography reveal similarities and marked differences in the interaction patterns compared with yeast Aar2p and imply phosphorylation-dependent regulation of AAR2 reminiscent of that in yeast. It is found that in vitro AAR2 seems to lock PRPF8 RH in a conformation that is only compatible with the first transesterification step of the splicing reaction and blocks a conformational switch to the step 2-like, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-coordinated conformation that is likely during U5 snRNP biogenesis. These findings extend the picture of AAR2 PRP8 interaction from yeast to humans and indicate a function for AAR2 in the spliceosomal assembly process beyond its role as an SNRNP200 placeholder in yeast.	2022	Structural and functional investigation of the human snRNP assembly factor AAR2 in complex with the RNase H-like domain of PRPF8.	36322420	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC4631593	10.1107/s2053230x15019202	In eukaryotes, the removal of nuclear noncoding sequences (pre-mRNA splicing) is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which consists of five ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs, each with a respective snRNA) and a plethora of protein factors that aid spliceosomal maturation, assembly, activation and disassembly. Recently, the U5 snRNP maturation factor Aar2p from baker's yeast has been characterized structurally and biochemically. Aar2p binds to the RNaseH (RH) and Jab1/MPN domains of the highly conserved U5-specific Prp8p, which forms a framework for the spliceosomal catalytic centre. Thereby, Aar2p sterically excludes Brr2p, a helicase essential for the catalytic activation of the spliceosome, from Prp8p binding. At the same time, Aar2p blocks U4/U6 di-snRNA binding to Prp8p. Aar2p therefore prevents premature spliceosome activation and its functions are regulated by reversible phosphorylation. To date, little is known about the hypothetical human Aar2 (hsAar2) orthologue C20ORF4. This study identifies C20ORF4 (i) as part of the HeLa proteome by Western blotting and (ii) as a true Aar2 orthologue which binds to the RH domain (hsRH) of Prp8 and corroborates an evolutionary link between yeast and human Aar2 function. An elaborate strategy was devised to crystallize hsAar2 in complex with hsRH. The analysis of initial weakly diffracting crystals obtained by in situ proteolysis and homology modelling guided the design of an hsAar2 construct in which an internal loop was replaced by three serines (hsAar2(Δloop)). A complex of hsAar2(Δloop) and hsRH crystallized in space group C2; the crystals diffracted to 2.35 Å resolution and were suitable for structure determination by molecular-replacement approaches. The study presented here suggests a connection between Aar2 and the spliceosome in human cells and paves the way for structural studies of human Aar2.	2015	Crystallization and biochemical characterization of the human spliceosomal Aar2-Prp8(RNaseH) complex.	26527271	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol

Notably, modern human genomes contain evolutionary information tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses that have impacted our ancestors-pointing to which viruses have future pandemic potential. Here, we apply evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to recover selection events involving tens of human genes that interact with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that likely started more than 20,000 years ago. These adaptive events were limited to the population ancestral to East Asian populations. Multiple lines of functional evidence support an ancient viral selective pressure, and East Asia is the geographical origin of several modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an ancient coronavirus, or with a different virus that happened to use similar interactions as coronaviruses with human hosts, may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations. By learning more about our ancient viral foes, our study highlights the promise of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future. Importantly, adaptation to ancient viral epidemics in specific human populations does not necessarily imply any difference in genetic susceptibility between different human populations, and the current evidence points toward an overwhelming impact of socioeconomic factors in the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).	2021	An ancient viral epidemic involving host coronavirus interacting genes more than 20,000 years ago in East Asia.	34171302	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol

In this article, preliminar experimental data, several available databases and bioinformatics tools such as the Cancer Genome Atlas, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, the JASPAR database and starBase were combined to analyze the correlation between genes and chromosomal aberrations, microRNA and transcription factors, as well as to explore the expression feature and potential regulative mechanism. The results showed that the most frequently unregulated genes in colorectal cancer arelocated on chromosome 20q, present a significant CNA-mRNA correlation.Furthermore, the genes with mRNA overexpression showed co-expression features and tended to be clustered within the same genomic neighborhoods. Then, several genes were selected to carry out further analysis and demonstrated that shared transcription factors, a conserved bidirectional promoter, and competition for a limited pool of microRNAin the 3'UTR of mRNA may be the underlying mechanisms behind the co-expression of physically adjacent genes.Finally, the databases, Lentivirus shRNA, and qPCR were used to find that these adjacent genes with co-expression cooperatively participated in the same biological pathways associated with the pathogenesis and development of colorectal cancer.	2017	Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the characterization and determination underlying mechanisms of over-expression and co-expression of genes residing on 20q in colorectal cancer.	29108255	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC7481981	10.29399/npa.24890	<h4>Introduction</h4>Aneuploids, copy number variations (CNVs), and single nucleotide variants in specific genes are the main genetic causes of developmental delay (DD) and intellectual disability disorder (IDD). These genetic changes can be detected using chromosome analysis, chromosomal microarray (CMA), and next-generation DNA sequencing techniques. Therefore; In this study, we aimed to investigate the importance of CMA in determining the genomic etiology of unexplained DD and IDD in 123 patients.<h4>Method</h4>For 123 patients, chromosome analysis, DNA fragment analysis and microarray were performed. Conventional G-band karyotype analysis from peripheral blood was performed as part of the initial screening tests. FMR1 gene CGG repeat number and methylation analysis were carried out to exclude fragile X syndrome.<h4>Results</h4>CMA analysis was performed in 123 unexplained IDD/DD patients with normal karyotypes and fragile X screening, which were evaluated by conventional cytogenetics. Forty-four CNVs were detected in 39 (39/123=31.7%) patients. Twelve CNV variant of unknown significance (VUS) (9.75%) patients and 7 CNV benign (5.69%) patients were reported. In 6 patients, one or more pathogenic CNVs were determined. Therefore, the diagnostic efficiency of CMA was found to be 31.7% (39/123).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Today, genetic analysis is still not part of the routine in the evaluation of IDD patients who present to psychiatry clinics. A genetic diagnosis from CMA can eliminate genetic question marks and thus alter the clinical management of patients. Approximately one-third of the positive CMA findings are clinically intervenable. However, the emergence of CNVs as important risk factors for multiple disorders increases the need for individuals with comorbid neurodevelopmental conditions to be the priority where the CMA test is recommended.	2020	Chromosomal Microarray Analysis in Turkish Patients with Unexplained Developmental Delay and Intellectual Developmental Disorders.	32952419	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC2946954	10.1371/journal.pbio.1000495	Because most extant viruses mutate rapidly and lack a true fossil record, their deep evolution and long-term substitution rates remain poorly understood. In addition to retroviruses, which rely on chromosomal integration for their replication, many other viruses replicate in the nucleus of their host's cells and are therefore prone to endogenization, a process that involves integration of viral DNA into the host's germline genome followed by long-term vertical inheritance. Such endogenous viruses are highly valuable as they provide a molecular fossil record of past viral invasions, which may be used to decipher the origins and long-term evolutionary characteristics of modern pathogenic viruses. Hepadnaviruses (Hepadnaviridae) are a family of small, partially double-stranded DNA viruses that include hepatitis B viruses. Here we report the discovery of endogenous hepadnaviruses in the genome of the zebra finch. We used a combination of cross-species analysis of orthologous insertions, molecular dating, and phylogenetic analyses to demonstrate that hepadnaviruses infiltrated repeatedly the germline genome of passerine birds. We provide evidence that some of the avian hepadnavirus integration events are at least 19 My old, which reveals a much deeper ancestry of Hepadnaviridae than could be inferred based on the coalescence times of modern hepadnaviruses. Furthermore, the remarkable sequence similarity between endogenous and extant avian hepadnaviruses (up to 75% identity) suggests that long-term substitution rates for these viruses are on the order of 10(-8) substitutions per site per year, which is a 1,000-fold slower than short-term rates estimated based on the sequences of circulating hepadnaviruses. Together, these results imply a drastic shift in our understanding of the time scale of hepadnavirus evolution, and suggest that the rapid evolutionary dynamics characterizing modern avian hepadnaviruses do not reflect their mode of evolution on a deep time scale.	2010	Genomic fossils calibrate the long-term evolution of hepadnaviruses. 	20927357	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol

DNA sequencing, spectral karyotyping and high density SNP array analysis was performed. The sensitivity of the BIN-67 cells to standard chemotherapeutic agents and to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and the JX-594 vaccinia virus was tested.<h4>Results</h4>BIN-67 cells were capable of forming spheroids in hanging drop cultures. When xenografted into immunodeficient mice, BIN-67 cells developed into tumours that reflected the hypercalcemia and histology of human SCCOHT, notably intense expression of WT-1 and vimentin, and lack of expression of inhibin. Somatic mutations in TP53 and the most common activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF were not found in BIN-67 cells by DNA sequencing. Spectral karyotyping revealed a largely normal diploid karyotype (in greater than 95% of cells) with a visibly shorter chromosome 20 contig. High density SNP array analysis also revealed few genomic anomalies in BIN-67 cells, which included loss of heterozygosity of an estimated 16.7 Mb interval on chromosome 20. SNP array analyses of four SCCOHT samples also indicated a low frequency of genomic anomalies in the majority of cases. Although resistant to platinum chemotherapeutic drugs, BIN-67 cell viability in vitro was reduced by > 75% after infection with oncolytic viruses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results show that SCCOHT differs from high-grade serous carcinomas by exhibiting few chromosomal anomalies and lacking TP53 mutations. Although BIN-67 cells are resistant to standard chemotherapeutic agents, their sensitivity to oncolytic viruses suggests that their therapeutic use in SCCOHT should be considered.	2013	Small cell ovarian carcinoma: genomic stability and responsiveness to therapeutics.	23433318	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC3658899	10.1186/1471-2350-14-50	<h4>Background</h4>The association of balanced rearrangements with breakpoints near SOX9 [SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9] with skeletal abnormalities has been ascribed to the presumptive altering of SOX9 expression by the direct disruption of regulatory elements, their separation from SOX9 or the effect of juxtaposed sequences.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We report on two sporadic apparently balanced translocations, t(7;17)(p13;q24) and t(17;20)(q24.3;q11.2), whose carriers have skeletal abnormalities that led to the diagnosis of acampomelic campomelic dysplasia (ACD; MIM 114290). No pathogenic chromosomal imbalances were detected by a-CGH. The chromosome 17 breakpoints were mapped, respectively, 917-855 kb and 601-585 kb upstream of the SOX9 gene. A distal cluster of balanced rearrangements breakpoints on chromosome 17 associated with SOX9-related skeletal disorders has been mapped to a segment 932-789 kb upstream of SOX9. In this cluster, the breakpoint of the herein described t(17;20) is the most telomeric to SOX9, thus allowing the redefining of the telomeric boundary of the distal breakpoint cluster region related to skeletal disorders to 601-585 kb upstream of SOX9. Although both patients have skeletal abnormalities, the t(7;17) carrier presents with relatively mild clinical features, whereas the t(17;20) was detected in a boy with severe broncheomalacia, depending on mechanical ventilation. Balanced and unbalanced rearrangements associated with disorders of sex determination led to the mapping of a regulatory region of SOX9 function on testicular differentiation to a 517-595 kb interval upstream of SOX9, in addition to TESCO (Testis-specific enhancer of SOX9 core). As the carrier of t(17;20) has an XY sex-chromosome constitution and normal male development for his age, the segment of chromosome 17 distal to the translocation breakpoint should contain the regulatory elements for normal testis development.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These two novel translocations illustrate the clinical variability in carriers of balanced translocations with breakpoints near SOX9. The translocation t(17;20) breakpoint provides further evidence for an additional testis-specific SOX9 enhancer 517 to 595 kb upstream of the SOX9 gene.	2013	The clinical impact of chromosomal rearrangements with breakpoints upstream of the SOX9 gene: two novel de novo balanced translocations associated with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia.	23648064	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC5793193	10.3390/genes9010042	Copy number variations (CNVs), which cover many functional genes, are associated with complex diseases, phenotypic diversity and traits that are economically important to raising chickens. The sex-determining region Y-box 6 (Sox6) plays a key role in fast-twitch muscle fiber differentiation of zebrafish and mice, but it is still unknown whether SOX6 plays a role in chicken skeletal muscle development. We identified two copy number polymorphisms (CNPs) which were significantly related to different traits on the genome level in chickens by AccuCopy® and CNVplex® analyses. Notably, five white recessive rock (CN = 1, CN = 3) variant individuals and two Xinghua (CN = 3) variant individuals contain a CNP13 (chromosome5: 10,500,294-10,675,531) which overlaps with SOX6. There is a disordered region in SOX6 proteins 265-579 aa coded by a partial CNV overlapping region. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression level of SOX6 mRNA was positively associated with CNV and highly expressed during the skeletal muscle cell differentiation in chickens. After the knockdown of the SOX6, the expression levels of IGFIR1, MYF6, SOX9, SHOX and CCND1 were significantly down-regulated. All of them directly linked to muscle development. These results suggest that the number of CNVs in the CNP13 is positively associated with the expression level of SOX6, which promotes the proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells by up-regulating the expression levels of the muscle-growth-related genes in chickens as in other animal species.	2018	Copy Number Variation in SOX6 Contributes to Chicken Muscle Development. 	29342086	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC5461031	10.1083/jcb.201701165	Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of five major small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). The pre-mRNA splicing factor PRPF8 is a crucial component of the U5 snRNP, and together with EFTUD2 and SNRNP200, it forms a central module of the spliceosome. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified assembly intermediates containing PRPF8, EFTUD2, and SNRNP200 in association with the HSP90/R2TP complex, its ZNHIT2 cofactor, and additional proteins. HSP90 and R2TP bind unassembled U5 proteins in the cytoplasm, stabilize them, and promote the formation of the U5 snRNP. We further found that PRPF8 mutants causing Retinitis pigmentosa assemble less efficiently with the U5 snRNP and bind more strongly to R2TP, with one mutant retained in the cytoplasm in an R2TP-dependent manner. We propose that the HSP90/R2TP chaperone system promotes the assembly of a key module of U5 snRNP while assuring the quality control of PRPF8. The proteomics data further reveal new interactions between R2TP and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), pointing to a potential link between growth signals and the assembly of key cellular machines.	2017	Assembly of the U5 snRNP component PRPF8 is controlled by the HSP90/R2TP chaperones.	28515276	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC4277924	10.1016/j.tpb.2014.11.001	Recent positive selection can increase the frequency of an advantageous mutant rapidly enough that a relatively long ancestral haplotype will be remained intact around it. We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify such haplotype structures. With HMM identified haplotype structures, a population genetic model for the extent of ancestral haplotypes is then adopted for parameter inference of the selection intensity and the allele age. Simulations show that this method can detect selection under a wide range of conditions and has higher power than the existing frequency spectrum-based method. In addition, it provides good estimate of the selection coefficients and allele ages for strong selection. The method analyzes large data sets in a reasonable amount of running time. This method is applied to HapMap III data for a genome scan, and identifies a list of candidate regions putatively under recent positive selection. It is also applied to several genes known to be under recent positive selection, including the LCT, KITLG and TYRP1 genes in Northern Europeans, and OCA2 in East Asians, to estimate their allele ages and selection coefficients.	2015	A hidden Markov model for investigating recent positive selection through haplotype structure.	25446961	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC3412124	10.1016/j.margen.2010.12.004	Uncharacterized open reading frames (ORFs) in human genomic sequence often show a high degree of evolutionary conservation, yet have little or no tissue EST or protein data suggestive of protein product function. The encoded proteins may have highly restricted expression in specialized cells, subcellular specializations, and/or narrow windows during development. One such highly specialized and minute subcellular compartment is the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where motorneurons contact muscle fibers. The electric Torpedo ray has evolved to expand the NMJ structure to the size of a large organ (electroplax organ), and we hypothesized that Torpedo electroplax proteins would be candidates for human ESTs expressed at the human NMJ. A total of 9719 primary electroplax cDNA clones were sequenced. We identified 44 human ORFs showing high (>63%) amino acid identity to Torpedo electroplax transcripts with enrichment for mRNA splicing motifs (SH2 and pre-mRNA splicing domains), an observation potentially important for the strict nuclear domains maintained by myonuclei underlying the NMJ. We generated antibodies against two uncharacterized human genes (C19orf29 [Drosophila cactin] and C15orf24) and showed that these were indeed expressed at the murine NMJ. Cactin, a member of the Rel transcription factor family in Drosophila, localized to the postsynaptic cytosol of the NMJ and nuclear membrane. C15orf24 protein localized to the murine postsynaptic sarcolemma. We show a novel approach towards identifying proteins expressed at a subcellular specialization using evolutionary diversity of organ function and cross-species mapping.	2011	Evolution and comparative genomics of subcellular specializations: EST sequencing of Torpedo electric organ.	21429463	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC4223495	10.1074/mcp.m113.037127	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are targets for cancer therapy. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is an HDAC inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. To obtain a better mechanistic understanding of the Sin3/HDAC complex in cancer, we extended its protein-protein interaction network and identified a mutually exclusive pair within the complex. We then assessed the effects of SAHA on the disruption of the complex network through six homologous baits. SAHA perturbs multiple protein interactions and therefore compromises the composition of large parts of the Sin3/HDAC network. A comparison of the effect of SAHA treatment on gene expression in breast cancer cells to a knockdown of the ING2 subunit indicated that a portion of the anticancer effects of SAHA may be attributed to the disruption of ING2's association with the complex. Our dynamic protein interaction network resource provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism of SAHA action and demonstrates the potential for drugs to rewire networks.	2014	Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)-induced dynamics of a human histone deacetylase protein interaction network.	25073741	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC1892924	10.1073/pnas.0611008104	In mammals, growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is the most important neuroendocrine factor that stimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary. In nonmammalian vertebrates, however, the previously named GHRH-like peptides were unable to demonstrate robust GH-releasing activities. In this article, we provide evidence that these GHRH-like peptides are homologues of mammalian PACAP-related peptides (PRP). Instead, GHRH peptides encoded in cDNAs isolated from goldfish, zebrafish, and African clawed frog were identified. Moreover, receptors specific for these GHRHs were characterized from goldfish and zebrafish. These GHRHs and GHRH receptors (GHRH-Rs) are phylogenetically and structurally more similar to their mammalian counterparts than the previously named GHRH-like peptides and GHRH-like receptors. Information regarding their chromosomal locations and organization of neighboring genes confirmed that they share the same origins as the mammalian genes. Functionally, the goldfish GHRH dose-dependently activates cAMP production in receptor-transfected CHO cells as well as GH release from goldfish pituitary cells. Tissue distribution studies showed that the goldfish GHRH is expressed almost exclusively in the brain, whereas the goldfish GHRH-R is actively expressed in brain and pituitary. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a previously uncharacterized GHRH-GHRH-R axis in nonmammalian vertebrates. Based on these data, a comprehensive evolutionary scheme for GHRH, PRP-PACAP, and PHI-VIP genes in relation to three rounds of genome duplication early on in vertebrate evolution is proposed. These GHRHs, also found in flounder, Fugu, medaka, stickleback, Tetraodon, and rainbow trout, provide research directions regarding the neuroendocrine control of growth in vertebrates.	2007	Discovery of growth hormone-releasing hormones and receptors in nonmammalian vertebrates.	17283332	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC4773048	10.1007/s11481-015-9645-6	Cannabinoid administration before and after simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-inoculation ameliorated disease progression and decreased inflammation in male rhesus macaques. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) did not increase viral load in brain tissue or produce additive neuropsychological impairment in SIV-infected macaques. To determine if the neuroimmunomodulation of Δ9-THC involved differential microRNA (miR) expression, miR expression in the striatum of uninfected macaques receiving vehicle (VEH) or Δ9-THC (THC) and SIV-infected macaques administered either vehicle (VEH/SIV) or Δ9-THC (THC/SIV) was profiled using next generation deep sequencing. Among the 24 miRs that were differentially expressed among the four groups, 16 miRs were modulated by THC in the presence of SIV. These 16 miRs were classified into four categories and the biological processes enriched by the target genes determined. Our results indicate that Δ9-THC modulates miRs that regulate mRNAs of proteins involved in 1) neurotrophin signaling, 2) MAPK signaling, and 3) cell cycle and immune response thus promoting an overall neuroprotective environment in the striatum of SIV-infected macaques. This is also reflected by increased Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression compared to the VEH/SIV group. Whether Δ9-THC-mediated modulation of epigenetic mechanisms provides neuroprotection in other regions of the brain and during chronic SIV-infection remains to be determined.	2016	Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) Promotes Neuroimmune-Modulatory MicroRNA Profile in Striatum of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)-Infected Macaques.	26607731	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC4860148	10.1002/mc.22385	The number of validated biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure is limited, and none exist for tobacco-related cancer. Additional biomarkers for smoke, effects on cellular systems in vivo are needed to improve early detection of lung cancer, and to assist the Food and Drug Administration in regulating exposures to tobacco products. We assessed the effects of smoking on the gene expression using human cell cultures and blood from a cross-sectional study. We profiled global transcriptional changes in cultured smokers' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) in vitro (n = 7) and from well-characterized smokers' blood (n = 36). ANOVA with adjustment for covariates and Pearson correlation were used for statistical analysis in this study. CSC in vitro altered the expression of 1 178 genes (177 genes with > 1.5-fold-change) at P < 0.05. In vivo, PBMCs of heavy and light smokers differed for 614 genes (29 with > 1.5-fold-change) at P < 0.05 (309 remaining significant after adjustment for age, race, and gender). Forty-one genes were persistently altered both in vitro and in vivo, 22 having the same expression pattern reported for non-small cell lung cancer. Our data provides evidence that persistent alterations of gene expression in vitro and in vivo may relate to carcinogenic effects of cigarette smoke, and the identified genes may serve as potential biomarkers for cancer. The use of an in vitro model to corroborate results from human studies provides a novel way to understand human exposure and effect. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	2016	Persistent alterations of gene expression profiling of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from smokers.	26294040	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol
PMC4409327	NA	NME1 is a well-documented metastasis suppressor gene, with suppressor activity demonstrated across a wide spectrum of human cancers including melanoma and carcinomas of the breast, stomach and thyroid. A primary aim of the current study was to identify profiles of genes whose expression is regulated by NME1 in cell lines of melanoma and thyroid carcinoma origin. Impact of NME1 was determined by forcing its expression transiently in cell lines using a novel Ad5-based adenoviral vector (Ad5-NME1), followed 48 h later by analysis of RNA expression profiles using the U133A microarray chip. Robust NME1 expression was achieved following infection with the Ad5-NME1 adenovirus in the human metastasis-derived cell lines WM1158 (melanoma) and WRO82 (follicular thyroid carcinoma), resulting in wide-ranging effects on gene expression in both settings. A substantial proportion of the NME1-regulated genes identified in the analyses were of clear potential relevance to metastasis, such as matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), SERPINB9 and colony stimulating factor receptor-2B (CSFR2B). Nine genes were identified (false discovery rate <0.1) that were regulated by NME1 in both the WM1158 and WRO82 cell lines, each possessing one or more such metastasis-relevant activities as stress fiber formation and focal adhesion (PPM1E, ZYX, PFN1), chemotaxis (CCR1) epithelial-mesenchymal signaling (WNT6), differentiation and morphogenesis (TBX4, ZFP36L2), and G protein modulation (GPR52 and PFN1). In addition, a number of the NME1-regulated genes were shown to be of prognostic value for distant disease-free survival and overall survival in melanoma and breast cancer. The combined expression of three NME1-regulated genes CSFR2B, MSF4A1 and SERPINB9 provided a strongly synergistic correlation with distant disease-free survival in the basal subtype of breast cancer (p<3.5e(-5), hazard ratio=0.33). Our study demonstrates that analysis of NME1-dependent gene expression is a powerful approach for identifying potential modulators of metastatic potential in multiple cancer types, which in turn may represent useful therapeutic targets. The study also highlights NME1-dependent genes as potential prognostic/diagnostic indices, which are profoundly lacking at present in melanoma.	2014	The metastasis suppressor NME1 regulates expression of genes linked to metastasis and patient outcome in melanoma and breast carcinoma.	25048347	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol

This study investigates human postmortem frontal cortex genome-wide DNA methylation profiles between 12 LOAD and 12 cognitively normal age- and gender-matched subjects. Quantitative DNA methylation is determined at 27,578 CpG sites spanning 14,475 genes via the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray. Data are analyzed using parallel linear models adjusting for age and gender with empirical Bayes standard error methods. Gene-specific technical and functional validation is performed on an additional 13 matched pair samples, encompassing a wider age range. Analysis reveals 948 CpG sites representing 918 unique genes as potentially associated with LOAD disease status pending confirmation in additional study populations. Across these 948 sites the subtle mean methylation difference between cases and controls is 2.9%. The CpG site with a minimum false discovery rate located in the promoter of the gene Transmembrane Protein 59 (TMEM59) is 7.3% hypomethylated in cases. Methylation at this site is functionally associated with tissue RNA and protein levels of the TMEM59 gene product. The TMEM59 gene identified from our discovery approach was recently implicated in amyloid-β protein precursor post-translational processing, supporting a role for epigenetic change in LOAD pathology. This study demonstrates widespread, modest discordant DNA methylation in LOAD-diseased tissue independent from DNA methylation changes with age. Identification of epigenetic biomarkers of LOAD risk may allow for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.	2012	Genome-wide DNA methylation differences between late-onset Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls in human frontal cortex.	22451312	C20orf4	AAR2	secondary_symbol

However, the molecular events occurring during brain aging are extremely complex and still largely unknown. For a better understanding of these age-associated modifications, animal models as close as possible to humans are needed. We thus analyzed the transcriptome of the temporal cortex of the primate Microcebus murinus using human oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix). Gene expression profiles were assessed in the temporal cortex of 6 young adults, 10 healthy old animals and 2 old, ""AD-like"" animals that presented ß-amyloid plaques and cortical atrophy, which are pathognomonic signs of AD in humans. Gene expression data of the 14,911 genes that were detected in at least 3 samples were analyzed. By SAM (significance analysis of microarrays), we identified 47 genes that discriminated young from healthy old and ""AD-like"" animals. These findings were confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA). ANOVA of the expression data from the three groups identified 695 genes (including the 47 genes previously identified by SAM and PCA) with significant changes of expression in old and ""AD-like"" in comparison to young animals. About one third of these genes showed similar changes of expression in healthy aging and in ""AD-like"" animals, whereas more than two thirds showed opposite changes in these two groups in comparison to young animals. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the 695 markers indicated that each group had distinct expression profiles which characterized each group, especially the ""AD-like"" group. Functional categorization showed that most of the genes that were up-regulated in healthy old animals and down-regulated in ""AD-like"" animals belonged to metabolic pathways, particularly protein synthesis. These data suggest the existence of compensatory mechanisms during physiological brain aging that disappear in ""AD-like"" animals.

In addition to known pre-mRNA splicing factors, 5' end binding factors, 3' end processing factors, mRNA export factors, hnRNPs and other RNA binding proteins, the protein components identified by mass spectrometry include RNA adenosine deaminases and several novel factors. Intriguingly, our purified supraspliceosomes also contain a number of structural proteins, nucleoporins, chromatin remodeling factors and several novel proteins that were absent from splicing complexes assembled in vitro.

The aims of the present study were to construct a recurrence risk prediction model and to reveal important OC genes or pathways. RNA sequencing data was obtained for 307 OC samples, and the corresponding clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Additionally, two validation datasets, GSE44104 (20 recurrent and 40 non‑recurrent OC samples) and GSE49997 (204 OC samples), were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes were screened using the differential expression via distance synthesis algorithm, followed by gene ontology enrichment analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Furthermore, subnetwork analysis was conducted for the protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network using the BioNet package. Finally, a random forest classifier was constructed based on the subnetwork nodes, and its reliability was validated using the GSE44104 and GSE49997 validation datasets. A total of 44 upregulated and 117 downregulated genes were identified in the recurrent samples. Enrichment analysis indicated that cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 (CYP17A1) was associated with 'positive regulation of steroid hormone biosynthetic processes'. WGCNA identified turquoise and grey modules that were significantly correlated with status and prognosis. A significant PPI subnetwork containing 16 nodes was also identified, including: Transcription factor GATA‑4; fibroblast growth factor 9; aromatase; 3β‑hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/δ5‑4‑isomerase type 2; corticosteroid 11β‑dehydrogenase isozyme 1; CYP17A1; pituitary homeobox 2; left‑right determination factor 1; homeobox protein ARX; estrogen receptor β; steroidogenic factor 1; forkhead box protein L2; myocardin; steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mitochondrial; vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter; and twist‑related protein 1. A random forest classifier was constructed using the subnetwork nodes as feature genes, which exhibited a 92% true positive rate when classifying recurrent and non‑recurrent OC samples. The classifying efficiency of the random forest classifier was validated using the two other independent datasets. Overall, 44 upregulated and 117 downregulated genes associated with OC recurrence were identified. Furthermore, the 16 subnetwork node genes that were identified may be important molecules in OC recurrence.	2018	A random forest classifier predicts recurrence risk in patients with ovarian cancer.	30066910	C8orf85	AARD	secondary_symbol

The network and pathway analysis were explored for feature genes, from which key molecules including FOXQ1 and SFRP1 were revealed to be densely connected with other molecules and participate in the validated metabolic pathways. Our study uncovered the differences among the four IHC-defined breast tumor subtypes at the mRNA and miRNA levels, presented a novel signature for breast tumor subtyping, and identified several key molecules potentially driving the heterogeneity of such tumors. The results help us further understand breast tumor heterogeneity, which could be availed in clinics.	2016	Exploring the intrinsic differences among breast tumor subtypes defined using immunohistochemistry markers based on the decision tree.	27786176	C8orf85	AARD	secondary_symbol
PMC5546599	10.1371/journal.pone.0181342	Decreased cell-substratum adhesion is crucially involved in metastasis. Previous studies demonstrated that lung cancer with floating cell clusters in histology is more likely to develop metastasis. In the present study, we investigated whether cancer cells in long-term, three-dimensional low attachment cultures acquire high metastatic potential; these cells were then used to examine the mechanisms underlying metastasis. Two KRAS-mutated adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 and H441) were cultured and selected on ultra-low attachment culture dishes, and the resulting cells were defined as FL (for floating) sublines. Cancer cells were inoculated into NOD/SCID mice via an intracardiac injection, and metastasis was evaluated using luciferase-based imaging and histopathology. In vitro cell growth (in attachment or suspension cultures), migration, and invasion were assayed. A whole genomic analysis was performed to identify key molecular alterations in FL sublines. Upon detachment on low-binding dishes, parental cells initially formed rounded spheroids with limited growth activity. However, over time in cultures, cells gradually formed smaller spheroids that grew slowly, and, after 3-4 months, we obtained FL sublines that regained prominent growth potential in suspension cultures. On ordinary dishes, FL cells reattached and exhibited a more spindle-shaped morphology than parental cells. No marked differences were observed in cell growth with attachment, migration, or invasion between FL sublines and parental cell lines; however, FL cells exhibited markedly increased growth potential under suspended conditions in vitro and stronger metastatic abilities in vivo. A genomic analysis identified epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and c-Myc amplification in A549-FL and H441-FL cells, respectively, as candidate mechanisms for metastasis. The growth potential of FL cells was markedly inhibited by lentiviral ZEB1 knockdown in A549-FL cells and by the inhibition of c-Myc through lentiviral knockdown or the pharmacological inhibitor JQ1 in H441-FL cells. Long-term three-dimensional low attachment cultures may become a useful method for investigating the mechanisms underlying metastasis mediated by decreased cell-substratum adhesion.	2017	Establishment of highly metastatic KRAS mutant lung cancer cell sublines in long-term three-dimensional low attachment cultures.	28786996	C8orf85	AARD	secondary_symbol
PMC2741491	10.1186/1471-2164-10-392	"<h4>Background</h4>Recent transcriptomic analyses in mammals have uncovered the widespread occurrence of endogenous antisense transcripts, termed natural antisense transcripts (NATs). NATs are transcribed from the opposite strand of the gene locus and are thought to control sense gene expression, but the mechanism of such regulation is as yet unknown. Although several thousand potential sense-antisense pairs have been identified in mammals, examples of functionally characterized NATs remain limited. To identify NAT candidates suitable for further functional analyses, we performed DNA microarray-based NAT screening using mouse adult normal tissues and mammary tumors to target not only the sense orientation but also the complementary strand of the annotated genes.<h4>Results</h4>First, we designed microarray probes to target the complementary strand of genes for which an antisense counterpart had been identified only in human public cDNA sources, but not in the mouse. We observed a prominent expression signal from 66.1% of 635 target genes, and 58 genes of these showed tissue-specific expression. Expression analyses of selected examples (Acaa1b and Aard) confirmed their dynamic transcription in vivo. Although interspecies conservation of NAT expression was previously investigated by the presence of cDNA sources in both species, our results suggest that there are more examples of human-mouse conserved NATs that could not be identified by cDNA sources. We also designed probes to target the complementary strand of well-characterized genes, including oncogenes, and compared the expression of these genes between mammary cancerous tissues and non-pathological tissues. We found that antisense expression of 95 genes of 404 well-annotated genes was markedly altered in tumor tissue compared with that in normal tissue and that 19 of these genes also exhibited changes in sense gene expression. These results highlight the importance of NAT expression in the regulation of cellular events and in pathological conditions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our microarray platform targeting the complementary strand of annotated genes successfully identified novel NATs that could not be identified by publically available cDNA data, and as such could not be detected by the usual ""sense-targeting"" microarray approach. Differentially expressed NATs monitored by this platform may provide candidates for investigations of gene function. An advantage of our microarray platform is that it can be applied to any genes and target samples of interest."	2009	Identification of novel endogenous antisense transcripts by DNA microarray analysis targeting complementary strand of annotated genes.	19698135	C8orf85	AARD	secondary_symbol
PMC5096291	10.1186/s13148-016-0281-7	<h4>Background</h4>Evidence is accumulating that nutritional exposures in utero can influence health outcomes in later life. Animal studies and human epidemiological studies have implicated epigenetic modifications as playing a key role in this process, but there are limited data from large well-controlled human intervention trials. This study utilized a large double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to test whether a defined nutritional exposure in utero, in this case docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), could alter the infant epigenome. Pregnant mothers consumed DHA-rich fish oil (800 mg DHA/day) or placebo supplements from 20 weeks' gestation to delivery. Blood spots were collected from the children at birth (<i>n</i> = 991) and blood leukocytes at 5 years (<i>n</i> = 667). Global DNA methylation was measured in all samples, and Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip arrays were used for genome-wide methylation profiling in a subset of 369 children at birth and 65 children at 5 years.<h4>Results</h4>There were no differences in global DNA methylation levels between the DHA and control group either at birth or at 5 years, but we identified 21 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at birth, showing small DNA methylation differences (<5%) between the treatment groups, some of which seemed to persist until 5 years. The number of DMRs at birth was greater in males (127 DMRs) and in females (72 DMRs) separately, indicating a gender-specific effect.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Maternal DHA supplementation during the second half of pregnancy had small effects on DNA methylation of infants. While the potential functional significance of these changes remains to be determined, these findings further support the role of epigenetic modifications in developmental programming in humans and point the way for future studies.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ACTRN12605000569606 and ACTRN12611001127998.	2016	Effect of prenatal DHA supplementation on the infant epigenome: results from a randomized controlled trial.	27822319	C8orf85	AARD	secondary_symbol
PMC4522592	10.1016/j.redox.2015.06.020	Isoniazid is used either alone or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis. It is also used for the prevention of tuberculosis. Chronic treatment of Isoniazid may cause severe liver damage leading to acute liver failure. The mechanism through which Isoniazid causes liver damage is investigated. Isoniazid treatment generates reactive oxygen species and induces apoptosis in Hep3B cells. It induces antioxidative and apoptotic genes leading to increase in mRNA expression and protein levels in Hep3B cells. Whole genome expression analysis of Hep3B cells treated with Isoniazid has resulted in differential expression of various genes playing prime role in regulation of apoptotic, antioxidative, DNA damage, cell signaling, cell proliferation and differentiation pathways. Isoniazid increased cytosolic Nrf2 protein level while decreased nuclear Nrf2 protein level. It also decreased ERK1 phosphorylation and treatment of Hep3B cells with ERK inhibitor followed by Isoniazid resulting in increased apoptosis in these cells. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis results have also shown differential expression of various protein species including heat shock proteins, proteins playing important role in oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation. Results suggest that Isoniazid induces apoptosis through oxidative stress and also prevents Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus by reducing ERK1 phosphorylation thus preventing cytoprotective effect.	2015	Isoniazid prevents Nrf2 translocation by inhibiting ERK1 phosphorylation and induces oxidative stress and apoptosis.	26202867	C8orf85	AARD	secondary_symbol
PMC3563612	10.1186/1471-2105-13-305	<h4>Background</h4>DNA capture technologies combined with high-throughput sequencing now enable cost-effective, deep-coverage, targeted sequencing of complete exomes. This is well suited for SNP discovery and genotyping. However there has been little attention devoted to Copy Number Variation (CNV) detection from exome capture datasets despite the potentially high impact of CNVs in exonic regions on protein function.<h4>Results</h4>As members of the 1000 Genomes Project analysis effort, we investigated 697 samples in which 931 genes were targeted and sampled with 454 or Illumina paired-end sequencing. We developed a rigorous Bayesian method to detect CNVs in the genes, based on read depth within target regions. Despite substantial variability in read coverage across samples and targeted exons, we were able to identify 107 heterozygous deletions in the dataset. The experimentally determined false discovery rate (FDR) of the cleanest dataset from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is 12.5%. We were able to substantially improve the FDR in a subset of gene deletion candidates that were adjacent to another gene deletion call (17 calls). The estimated sensitivity of our call-set was 45%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrates that exonic sequencing datasets, collected both in population based and medical sequencing projects, will be a useful substrate for detecting genic CNV events, particularly deletions. Based on the number of events we found and the sensitivity of the methods in the present dataset, we estimate on average 16 genic heterozygous deletions per individual genome. Our power analysis informs ongoing and future projects about sequencing depth and uniformity of read coverage required for efficient detection.	2012	Copy Number Variation detection from 1000 Genomes Project exon capture sequencing data.	23157288	C8orf85	AARD	secondary_symbol

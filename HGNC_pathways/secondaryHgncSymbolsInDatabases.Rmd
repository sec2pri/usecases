title: "Secondary HGNC Symbols used in different Databases"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

This script compares gene symbol names from four different databases (KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways, Gene Ontology) to the list of outdated HGNC symbols.

## 0. Notebook setup
The first section of this Notebook lists all the libraries required to run this script.

```{r}
#Package manager:
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
#Package for path variable
if(!"rstudioapi" %in% installed.packages()) BiocManager::install("rstudioapi")
#Libraries required for markdown documents:
if(!"markdown" %in% installed.packages()){install.packages("markdown")}
if(!"rmarkdown" %in% installed.packages()){install.packages("rmarkdown")}

#load libraries
library(rstudioapi)

# set working environment to current folder
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path))
```

## 1. HGNC Symbol data download
First, we load all the secondary symbols of HGNC to be used in this comparison.
We filter out the symbols which are used as both primary and secondary symbols.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

## 2. Data Download
We download the data for each database, based on their API or RDF (depending on availability).

### 1. KEGG

### 2. Reactome

### 1. WikiPathways

### 4. Gene Ontology

From the Quick-GO website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/), we downloaded data based on the following criteria:
I. Taxon: 9606 (Homo sapiens, human).
II. Gene product type: Proteins, Reviewed (Swiss-Prot), all settings for Proteomes.

Data was downloaded on: 1st of August, with 5199 annotations, as a TSV file.
```{r}
# Obtain Working Directory to find data
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path))
getwd()
setwd('..')
work_DIR <- getwd()

##GO terms
go_terms <- read.delim(file = "Data/QuickGO-annotations-1659356807403-20220801.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = '\t')
go_terms_unique <- unique(go_terms$SYMBOL)

# Set Working Directory back to current folder
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path))
work_DIR <- getwd()

```

## 3. Data Comparison
We compare the data for each database to the secondary HGNC symbols.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

## 4. Data Visualization
We visualize the data for all databases combined.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

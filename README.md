# Usage of secondary HGNC symbols in literature

We use the EuropePMC search API call ([documentation](https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService#!/Europe32PMC32Articles32RESTful32API/search)) to retrieve matching publications (symbol in abstract, filtered for MESH term 'Human'), and some of their metadata for each of the symbols.
